R3IZCMYPSVY5MD,B00004SY4H,"5.0 out of 5 stars So Nice, I Bought Them Twice",Alice Majdali,5,"Updated (6/20/21) - HD600's are still a great pair of headphones, and here's what I've learned since I bought mine. You get out what you put in; these headphones like better quality recordings, so if you have live-recorded and properly made music, you can crank that music up and it will sound phenomenal. With poor quality recordings, you'll find yourself steering away from those songs pretty quickly with how badly they sound. These are good to listen to records with, too, as long as you have a decent record player. I've had my HD600's for 4 years now, and they're still going strong. You may need to replace the cable, earcups, and headband over time, but these will last you a very long time.TL:DR - These headphones are great, especially for the price. The sound is neutral, but the quality is far from lacking.FULL REVIEW Despite an issue with my first pair of HD 600's, I liked the sound so much I got a second pair once the first was returned. Here's what I've found out about the HD 600's in the 6 months I've had them.Comfort - These headphones are very lightweight, so it's easy to forget you're wearing them. However, when you first get them, these headphones clamp your head hard. Keep on using them and let the headband stretch out, and over time you'll be able to wear them for literally all-day use without any soreness. W/O Amp and DAC - The bass is very recessed on anything you listen to without a proper amp. Mids and highs are still good, but the sound isn't as full or realistic without a proper amp. The sound is still good enough to outperform everything else I've tried and blew me away when I first tried them out, which was with this set up.W/ Amp and DAC (Magni 2 and Modi 2) - The music really seemed to come to life. From classical remixes of songs to Slash's performance in Paradise City, these headphones still leave me impressed. Bass, mids, and highs all sound good with none over powering the other. There is a lot of detail with these, which has led me to picking up background sounds I couldn't hear or overlooked before. Hearing a lot of extra details in music I already knew took a bit of getting used to, but I very quickly started to like certain songs more because I realize they had more sounds than I realized. This has been very helpful when comparing the sound between my HD 600's and other speakers and headphones I've tried. The only real problem with the HD 600's is that if there are any imperfections in your music, such as problems with sound mastering or just being an MP3 you converted from YouTube, you will hear every imperfection. Keep that in mind when getting these or other audiophile grade headphones; you will need to get CD's or, at the barest minimum, 320 kbps MP3's for listening to music. The static and distortion in anything lower quality will be really annoying. Not to mention their open-back design and 300 ohms of impedance mean you shouldn't be using them while traveling, though this doesn't bother me as I use the at home.Overall, if you want to get a pair of audiophile grade headphones for under $300 and you can afford these, do not hesitate. There are definitely other and better options out there, but not for the same price as these (unless these go back up $385 again for a short period). Sure, they aren't the best sounding headphones in the world and the $270 I spent when I got these is still a lot of money, but I haven't regretted these since I got them. These changed my perspective on listening to music for the better and you'd be hard pressed to go wrong with buying a pair of HD 600's.","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2017",AEMGPCOP7KJAQSGPZRNU2DBE2AXQ,True,23,
R2SDQ12KSFZO7,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars A great headphone for $300,Bleak,5,"For $300, the HD600 even with it's current cheaper -feeling build is still a great value. If you're not an audiophile or don't listen to music with much care for the detail or production, then you probably don't need them. Ironically, the HD600 just so happens to be a headphone that really reveals the quality of the track your listening to. It has a relatively neutral frequency response, but that honestly doesn't say much by itself.The headphone is primarily great for enjoying mids, while providing sufficient bass and delivering a nice and stinging snare (the way you should want it :O). The imaging and soundstage is relatively narrow, but actually exists unlike on the HD6XX, which lets the HD600 actually let vocals pop-out more. The sound is very in your face, it delivers intensity and a certain rawness without sounding too harsh. It still has detail and reveals the timbre of instrumentals really well. As long as you're driving these headphones pretty well with a good DAC/Amp setup, they should sound magnificent. Acoustic guitar, male vocals, and instrumentals in general are among my favorite type of music for listening to with the HD600.The only thing, which I think is kind of up for debate is the so called ""veil"". When I first listened to the HD600 they of course sounded amazing, nearly perfect. When I tried another headphone, however, the Hifiman Edition XS and then switched back to the HD600, things got a little weird. I felt like I couldn't recognize the same sound I had once heard from the HD600. Things just started to sound unclear, but after a day to let my mind refresh, the HD600 sounded fine as they normally would. To this day I'm still unclear as to what the Sennheiser ""veil"" is supposed to mean, but it might certainly exist. However, this is not an actual problem if you drive these headphones daily.You don't really even need to read my review to understand how important these headphones are. The tonality of these headphones and what Sennheiser has to offer is pretty much embedded within these headphones. They've withstood the test of time for nearly, what, like 25 years? They're a part of most of audiophile collects I bet, and I know quite a fair number of people who either have the HD600 or the HD6XX. If you want a more neutral and intense sound with actual imaging for more well-produced songs, go for the HD600. If you want a similar sound to the HD600, but something more comfortable in exchange for less soundstage, go for the 6XX, they're better for instrumentals I find.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2022",AHQANXFCWQKJCPESVD227DUEXJWA,True,10,
R4WSXVUD6BPH,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful Headphones,M. Rickard,5,"I have sort of an emotional attachment to these headphones. I've had them since September 25th, 2011, and I love them/their sound more now than I did back when they were new. I just figured I'd finally drop in and say some words about this product.Equipment:I have a Bottlehead Crack amp with speedball upgrade. I also have some nice tubes (about $75 each) plugged into my amp. I have an HRT Music Streamer II+ running from my computer into my amp. I've gone through the typical route of entry-level amp/dacs, grabbing the Fiio E7/E9, Electric Avenue PA2V2, and Fiio E17 along my journey of tasty music. I've heard the Bottlehead Crack with multiple different stock or ""cheap"" tubes, and now with my nice ones that I researched around before buying. Also, I replaced the cable with the HD 650 cable (mainly it's just more durable imo).The Headphones:They're beautifully made. Their aesthetic is fairly timeless if you ask me, as is true of any well-designed product. They're stiff and strong, and they really fit well. I can keep them on my head for about 6+ hours at a time before having to rip them off, which is truly saying a lot. My ATH-M50's are really uncomfortable by comparison. I love the velour pads and the memory foam padding, they're really nice and I personally love them, I'll never go with anything but velour earpads ever again after being treated to HD 600's pads. I have since ordered Velour pads for my ATH-M50s and it's a much-needed upgrade in the comfort department.The Sound:The sound is *very* clean and balanced, which is what these headphones are known for. The whole breadth of the music, from the lowest lows to the peaking (yet non-fatiguing) highs are apparent in every song of every genre. There are no awkward boomy frequencies, and nothing sticks out more than anything else. As an example, times when this is most apparent is during a jazz track with an upright bass. The upright bass is naturally a loose-sounding/boomy instrument where the bass vibrates in and out of different volume levels every time it's plucked. These headphones can tame the loose upright bass, while the piano, drums, and brass have their separated place, playing as a blended ensemble instead of a just collection of instruments. These headphones are very revealing, and it's amazing to come from listening to ""veiled"" headphones (headphones that muck up detail) to this analytical sound.[Side Note]:Before I broke them in, they sounded a little too ""dry"", aka 2-dimensional, flat or lifeless in a sense, where there's not really any excitement or dynamism to the sound. It was detailed, but not dynamic or lively. After breaking the headphones in for 200 hours, they are much better, as are any and every headphone I've ever had. Breaking-in headphones truly works, I've experienced it with speakers, subwoofers, and headphones all all the same (except earbuds).If you're used to a lot of bass, it can *seem* disappointing, but if you give these headphones enough juice through a nice amp and DAC, the sound fills out nicely. The bass becomes more full, bellowing and resonant, but NEVER overpowering; always tasteful and clean. Separation of instruments increases, allowing you to hear more pieces of the music at once instead of one wall of sound. It almost seems like the HD 600's grow additional mini-speakers within the drivers to play each part of a song separately, as that's the best way I can describe it.In short, the sound becomes full-bodied and never fatiguing when you give these cans the juice they need to shine.Also, don't be afraid to spend money on a $300 amp and DAC, seriously. I baby-stepped my way through, and I'll say that I never really had that come to Jesus moment until I got the Bottlehead Crack amp. Also, when you're listening for differences or trying to justify that you just bought this amp and are going to ""hear"" the differences, you won't really ""hear"" it. You can't ""listen"" for more of this or more of that, more bass or more separation, it's honest to god just a feeling. To me, I felt myself bobbing my head a lot more than I usually did with songs I'd heard many times before, because I was really feeling the music in my head bounce like never before. It's not quantitative, it's a feeling more than anything, and the head-bobbing will be your yardstick here, it was for me!I love these cans, I love the design, I love Sennheiser, and I love the capacity for growth through the use of amps and DACs. Also, I love head-fi.org, it's your ticket to peer-reviewed audio bliss.Thanks for reading, and I wish you luck on finding your favorite cans!","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2013",AGKZFMYNH2OTED2PX6B2HLEEXACA,True,11,
RYZNEGJZXKINY,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars These are legends for a reason!,IommiFan85,5,"General Thoughts: Coming from the Philips X2 this headphone was full of surprises! First of all I could not detect this veil people were talking about. On various forums these can's were described as being recessed sounding; Like you were sitting in the back row at a concert. To me they were the opposite! Everything sounded very clear and crisp to my ears and I felt as though I was on stage with the musicians. These headphones were also characterized as being boring but I found that I can rock out with them! I was also surprised at how easy they were to drive. I have an O2 amp/ODAC and I rarely had to engage the high gain mode to get my desired volume. Very cool.Sound: The midrange is definitely the highlight of these cans. They are in your face and will immediately grab you and pull you in! Both male and female vocals sound very good on these. If you prefer a more intimate midrange then these are the headphones for you! Bass is a bit light but not as bad as I was expecting. Still I would prefer a bit more as everything sounds somewhat thin. The treble was another surprise as I found them to be a little too shouty for my tastes; specifically in the upper midrange to lower treble. Then again I have pretty sensitive hearing so this may not be a problem for others. The sound was very clear and not lacking in energy. The soundstage though was almost practically missing! There was never a moment when a voice seemed to be shouting from across the room or from behind.Comfort: The comfort was good but not great. There's definitely a clamp on these. They do get a little annoying after awhile but then again I have a big head so YMMV here. The X2's on the other hand almost disappear on my noggin'. They are easily the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn.Build Quality: Somewhat lacking. It feels like the plastic on the headband will crack under slightest amount of pressure. They feel very cheap to me. These headphones do not seem to be built to last and I could see myself breaking them within a few years even though I'm very careful with my possessions. If they were to fall on tile or a hardwood floor then I could see them breaking or cracking easily. The X2's on the other hand are built like a tank! You'd have to run over those with a car to damage them!Conclusion: All in all these are very nice headphones. They have a reputation of being the gold standard for headphones and though I feel that's somewhat justified I still prefer my X2's. If you get the HD600's then I think you'll be pleased with them. They sound very natural but do lack a bit of the fun factor of the X2's. If you like to analyze your music or do any kind of mixing then these should definitely be on your short list! If it wasn't for the X2's then these might be my go to headphones despite their shortcomings.Update (2/6/16):Well it seems that my X2's bit the dust. I barely had them for 6 months when the right side driver blew. I returned them to Philips for a full refund as I was within warranty however the new version I procured sounded very little like the original. Bigger but less controlled bass, very little treble to speak of, and an even more distant midrange! Needless to say I returned them to Amazon as soon as I could! Thanks for ruining an excellent headphone Gibson! I liked the HD600's a lot due to the naturalness of their tone but I didn't care for their somewhat lacking bass and their annoying upper mids. So I decided to give the HD650's a try considering they were very similar in tone and I was totally blown away! They had all the things I loved about the HD600's but with more bass and none of the peaky upper mids! They also have a larger soundstage though not as large as the X2's. The midrange is to die for and these are now my go to headphones for rock! Even electronic music sounds very good on them. So if you're like me and enjoy some bass with your music but still want beautiful mids then give the HD650's a try. You'll be glad you did!","Reviewed in the United States October 6, 2015",AEQKFTGXHXK4VZVNJ4OLMIJYYRUA,True,11,
R12JTTAEXZ62I0,B00004SY4H,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid. But not for recording.,Jamie,4,"Overall sound is lovely! Very true to tone, wonderful to use while mixing and mastering audio tracks. The cord is super long so it’s nice for a proper studio session listening back and moving around if you’re maneuvering with swapping instruments. But because of that - they wouldn’t be very portable/travel friendly and I’d be EXTRA cautious not to snag them and accidentally tear the wire. Wire doesn’t disconnect from the actual headphones either so no bluetooth on this buddy.Biggest gripe would be the soundleak. I originally got these thinking that it would be a great addition to my recording setup. Super comfortable and breathable without the physical pressure some headphones may have. But the openback design makes the audio leak in recordings very, very challenging to deal with.So overall, I love the sound, comfort and bulky style that gives plenty of room for the ears! Best used for mixing and getting a true neutral sound gauge on a project. I personally wouldn’t use them to record the audio itself though. Solid 8.5/10.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AFYBVINSYY5VPS2B734AAX5SCHEQ,True,0,
R1JH6TKCOEKMM4,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars Goldilocks' Cans,C,5,"It's easy to forget that, next year, the HD 600 will turn 20 years old. Admittedly, audio transducers have a funny way of sticking around longer than just about any other piece of electronics equipment. A line of speakers will, usually, be in production for at least several years. Even when they've been replaced, they usually aren't even close to obsolete, because even mid-fi has gotten pretty far into diminishing returns. But, even in this alternate timeline of audiophile-dom (others might call it an alternate reality, an insane asylum...) the HD 600s are freakin ancient. I can only think of a few other cans with this kind of longevity:The Sony MDR-V6; so old that it still has ""for DIGITAL"" emblazoned on the side. A quick trip through audio theory will reveal that this is meaningless, but in 1985 it sounded really cool.The Beyerdynamic DT770/880/990; so old that they still have shag carpet earpads.Various Grados; so old that it's too late for anybody to admit they sound like trash. Instead, they just mumble something about ""sparkle"" and then go buy something else.And yet, 20 years later, the HD600 is still the headphone that, within headphone circles, everybody talks about and everybody has heard. There's a reason for that: it's not just really good. Purely on the strength of its sound, it stands out as excellent. When price is considered? It might just be the best headphone in the world.THE SOUND:Inevitably, whenever anyone tries to talk about the HD600 or the HD650, someone brings up the ""Sennheiser Veil."" This so-called veil was a kind of muffling of the sound, and the people who complain about it would have you believe that the HD6XX sounds like Apple Earpods.I cannot state emphatically enough how much the veil does not exist. It is either a product of the imagination of people who wish the AKG K701 was a bit brighter, or the result of people trying to plug the HD6XX straight into an inadequate source, i.e. most phones, MP3 players, iPods, laptops, etc. They need an amp. More on that later. At any rate, these headphones are as veiled as Eva Green in The Dreamers. You. Will. See. erm, Hear. Everything.That's both a blessing and a curse. Lesser headphones - even my Sony MDR-V6s, for instance - can mask the flaws in a bad recording. All of those 128kbps MP3s you've pirated because you're a bad person? They're gonna sound awful. If your father-in-law-to-be hands sends you some recordings of his garage band, grab however awful a set of backup cans you need for it to sound good. Because these will tell you the truth. Yet, to a good recording, they are shockingly flattering. If you put garbage in, you'll get garbage out. Give it something good, though, and you'll get magic. I've listened to just about my entire music library with these, and there are a few recordings in particular that really demonstrate how well these shine:-In the Air Tonight (Phil Collins, Face Value, 1981): On a decent-to-good set of headphones, this song sounds ominous; it sounds cool. Whatever. On the HD600s, it's a religious experience. Sounds swirl around your head. The crescendos and diminuendos blow you away. The vocals sound perfect. Incredible.-In Your Eyes (Peter Gabriel, So, 1986): The entire album is fabulous. Listen to it over and over again. But there's a reason this song is singled out. It's a sibilance nightmare. On my MDR-V6s, it's unlistenable above a moderate volume. Enter the HD600s: there's no hiding how much sibilance there is, but they handle it as gracefully as possible.Enough ink has been spilled over how these handle classical and jazz (spoiler: fabulously), and their vocal presentation in particular is spot-on.THE STUFF YOU'LL NEED:To get all of this brilliant sound, you're going to need a few things. First and foremost is an amp. This can get crazy pretty quick, so first let's draw a distinction: solid state vs tubes. The HD600 has a high enough impedance to really get along with OTL amps (ie, most headphone tube amps). This will color the sound somewhat, get hot, be unreliable, need to warm up, etc. If you want to go down this road, you can. There's also a lot of really expensive solid state amps.Or, you could just get a Schiit Magni or a JDS Objective2, both of which sound... well... about perfect.Next, you'll need to think about a DAC. Now, a lot of people just assume they'll need one. That may not be the case. If you have a Retina Macbook Pro, for instance, skip it. You'll never hear the difference between it and whatever you get for 150 bucks. Same deal if you're plugging a (good) CD player or receiver or whatever straight into the amp. If your source is something else, like a midrange PC, you'll need to evaluate this yourself. Unfortunately, I can't help you with that.If you decide you need a DAC, there are a lot of expensive options out there.Or, you could just get a Schiit Modi or a JDS ODAC, both of which sound... well... about perfect.(Side lesson: The internet audiophile community fights back and forth all the time about whether the O2/ODAC or the Magni/Modi is the better setup. Realistically, their performance is nearly identical. Buy whichever you think looks better.)(Another side lesson: You seriously probably don't need to spend a ton of money on DACs and amps. The O2/ODAC was designed by some wacky internet crusader who wanted to prove that the performance of the Benchmark DAC2 and HPA2 could be achieved without spending thousands of dollars. From an engineering perspective, this is obviously possible. If you look into this further, you will still find people who insist that the O2/ODAC doesn't sound as good as significantly more expensive gear. Just remember that these are audiophile crazies, who think they need 192kHz recordings because Nyquist-Shannon doesn't apply to special snowflakes. The two most important things in any digital-to-analog system are the input file and the transducer.)Finally, you're going to need good recordings. iTunes is sufficient. Vinyl is pretty good (repeat after me: vinyl does not sound better than CD, it is objectively worse, a record will only sound great 25 times, and will be the equal of the CD never). CD is your best bet, particularly those mastered before the ""loudness wars"" started up in the late 1990s. However, the world isn't perfect; fear not, the Senns still sound good with stuff that has a compressed dynamic range (within reason). Anything beyond the Redbook CD standard is simply a ploy to get you to spend more money for things you can't hear, and that your dog can't either.SOME REALITIES:The way that the Senns achieve all this great sound is by being ""open-back"" headphones. This means that, on the side of the driver opposite your ear, there's just some mesh to protect it from damage. This means that you can't really use these outside a quiet environment, because you'll hear everything around you. It also means that you probably won't want to listen to them in public, because it's really difficult to look cool when everybody knows you're blasting the Bangles.Also, they're ugly as sin. But they aren't leaving your house, so who cares?A WORD ABOUT THE HD650:Released several years after the HD600, the HD650 at first glance looks like an upgrade. That... depends. The HD650 is darker and smoother at the expense of detail. That's all. I prefer its sound signature. But, it usually costs between 75 and 150 dollars more than the HD600, and so it wasn't worth it for me. It probably isn't worth it for you, either.So, yeah. These headphones sound just about dead neutral, wonderfully crisp, and yet smooth enough that you can listen at high volumes without fatigue. They can usually be had for less than 300 dollars. And for the price, they have no equal. Now we just have to hope that someday the HD800S can be such an easy decision to make.","Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2016",AGELJ3PKP4WPDMEFQ4OMAHLFZ25Q,True,118,

In audio quality, ultra comfort and breathability.I hated wearing headphones because of head pain all over and I didn't like the brightness of the audio for the AT m50 or closed backs. I didn't think the DT 900 would let me down, it did for my taste. Yet the 600 HD gives me clear and most importantly -beautiful audio.

R3JQ473PFFO6VO,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars Punching way above their cost.,Crank,5,"Edit Oct. 2021: Bought a brand new pair with the much more sophisticated design. Purchased from Ebay seller, and they came in the super duper cheap box they have going now. Many will recall the originals came in a hard case with foam that gave them some prestige.Some reviews have called the new line out as not being as sturdy. Maybe that was an old production run. The ones I have are premium, feel much nicer than my older pair, and comparing sweeps in both ears are also more accurate and matched better. All things considered, these are the gold standard at this price range. The 650 vs 600 argument is done to death, but in the end it's much easier to EQ down in treble than it is to EQ out a midbass hump and boost treble that is not properly there in the first place.I usually EQ higher treble down a bit on most headphones. Even going natural the 600s are amazing. Fully balanced. And now with a super deluxe finish that they have deserved for years. Yes, the packaging is cheaper. Too cheap IMO, but I had no damage and no major issues with my pair. Sennheiser has made the 600s into a mini-tentpole headphone for the next couple decades at least.These look superb, and in hand they feel better than tawdry, faux-marble design of the last pair. Smoother. No creakiness either. No longer do these look like chintzy 80s headphones. They look like superior cans from a modern age. They still have the red cord wrap on the left side to distinguish them from the 650s. Otherwise, they are much the same as the old pair outside the new bezel and headband, which are absolutely worth updating if yours are super old.Throughout the midrange and treble I find them nearly unmatched in the 200-500 dollar range. The sound of the instruments is natural and immersive. The design is very comfortable for me barring the first few days of getting the headband to mold to your head. I have a larger head and no issues.I think the sound is great for all genres. Some may want a different type of sound from certain genres and should look at various in-depth reviews to make their decision, such as those at inner fidelity and other audio sites.I feel the bass and balance in these remains great, especially on a nicely matched pair. Some people may want more bass, and they should look around to find the various comparisons on different sets. As far as having a neutral and beautiful set of cans for most material, it's nearly impossible to beat these in the 200-500 dollar range. Highly recommended on every level. Essential for audio enthusiasts, but do remember they are 300 ohm headphones and require extra power to sound their best.","Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2016",AH3ICCTF4GUQ75BASLIXFJLPXLQA,True,5,
R18PFC2ZZ1IGON,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars All the very positive reviews cannot be wrong.... and they aren't,forkboy1965,5,"My road to the Sennheiser HD 600's has been a little long and filled with some interesting twists and turns that have, or so I hope, led me to a better understanding of what are a great set of headphones. Naturally it is very typical to wish to compare these to other headphones. After all, isn't that how we so often make purchasing decisions? We try differing products until we find the one which works best/right for our needs. So my review is going to work on two fronts: a review of the product itself, and a review against some competitors I have acquired in the last year in my quest to find headphones that are right for me. And hopefully for you.Regarding the HD600's themselves I have mostly nothing but excellent news to report. Personally, I like the way they look. The mottled black and blue coloring is different, but not garish in any way. The large and deep oval ear cups are precisely what one wants for an over-the-ear design. At 6'4"" I'm certainly sporting a larger head than the average male and fortunately for me my entire ears fit comfortably inside the ear cups. My ears do not touch the protective cloth over the drivers, but the outer edge of my ear does touch at places around the inside of the ear cup. This is a minor annoyance and goes unnoticed some of the time. Those of you more average of height and head size will likely never have this issue. The ear cups themselves are very comfortable, seal well to my head and do not get hot even after a good number of hours of use. This also means the head clamping force is perfect for me; I never feel like my head is being squeezed. Everything about the headphones seems to indicate they are well-made, but I cannot help but feel the plastic seems a bit thin. Maybe cheap even. They do not creak and nothing flexes, but it's the only part which lets me down at all about the headphones.The included box, while awesome for storage, is clearly not oriented for travel. But I would argue these aren't portable headphones meant for the on-the-go user. They do not fold up. The ear cups do not turn to lay flat. And considering the amplification needed to properly drive these, using a typical portable music player (your cell phone, iPod, etc.) isn't ideal anyway.Now for what I consider to be the more important part of how I came to select the HD600: research and listening. Let's first be clear about something... audio equipment is not unlike some other equipment markets in that you often spend exponentially more money for an item just to gain minor, incremental increases in some important criteria. To you speaker X sounds better than speaker Y, all other things being equal. It's likely speaker X costs more. Most of the time it will cost more, but not all of the time. But how much more does it cost and how much more quality of sound are you receiving for that additional cost? It's almost always a matter of diminishing returns... loads more money for a bit firmer bass or slightly clearer treble. But this is the nirvana for which we seek in audio equipment.Over the last year I purchased two other sets of headphones: Grado 80e and Sennheiser Momentum. Clearly the Grado's at $100 are the least expensive with the Momentum jumping up markedly to $299, while the more recently acquired Sennheiser HD600 hit the $400 mark. Comparing my first two purchases, the 80e's and Momentum's, the differences were pretty straight-forwarded. To me the Grado's sounded brighter with good bass and sligthly harsh mids (""smeared"" is the word which came to mind as I compared them in listening tests at home). The Mometum's sounded more laid back (not as bright) with great bass (that could be a bit smeared itself in the upper bass) and definitely superior mids (thinking men's voices here - became painfully obvious will using a live track from Morrissey between the two headphones). And so it was I came to find myself using each pair for different purposes.The Grado 80e's became my preferred can for classical music (a genre into which I am becoming more deeply involved of late) as I felt, for my personal preferences, the brighter qualities enhanced the instruments typical of classical music, while the bass was more than sufficient. But when I wanted to rock (or alternative as is more often the case) I broke out the Momentum's. The accentuated, but not overblown bass, was quite welcome and I noticed less the laid back nature of the treble, especially as I used them more and more.But with the also recent purchase of some better home audio equipment (Marantz CD6005 CD player and a SoundEngine D1 DAC/Headphone amp for my computer - listening to ALAC encoded tracks) I found myself thinking both the Momentum and 80e were somehow lacking. That I wasn't getting everything I could from my music via this better equipment.From all the research I had done previously I elected to spend the money and purchase the HD600. I don't think I have found a single bad review out there in the Internet sphere. A few have thought them a little warm or laid back. But most every review hits upon how, and especially for the money, the HD600s hit all the right notes (sorry). Having had them burned in for 30-hours the listening tests began. I had considered this purchase principally for classical music. I really didn't think I'd get more from them for rock/alternative than I was already getting from the Momentums and so it was the classical CDs came out and I plugged into the CD player. I also plugged in the Grados to the Marantz A/V receiver, direct mode engaged. Adjusting for volume as best I could (this is hardly scientific) I played a handful of very familiar tracks from very familiar CDs; swapping back and forth between the HD600s and Grado 80e.It too almost no time to hear the difference. I'll concede that it's sometimes difficult to put into words the differences heard, but I'll try. The first thing I noticed were the violins. When a number of them are playing notes together the Grado's sounded smeared compared to the HD600s. Not unlike a poorly created JPEG from a digital point-n-shoot versus a well-made JPEG from an original RAW processed via Adobe Lightroom. Details are are lost in the former, but the latter does a far superior job of keeping the detail even in the process of losing information. The HD600 left me feeling like I was actually sitting there in the room with the musicians. I'm not referring to placement of the instruments (the HD600 do a good job, but I've read reviews for other cans that do better), but simply how clear, precise, concise and live-sounding are the violins. Actually, it was true of all the stringed instruments. The resonance of the strings... their very clear nature... was a welcome and astonishing difference.Granted, the Grado's are one-quarter the cost and I shouldn't be surprised the HD600's sounded better. Markedly better. And I didn't have to listen long or hard to notice the differences. They are obvious; not subtle. That said, I can't say I was every displeased with the Grado's. It was only in comparison to the HD600's that it became possible to hear and understand the Grado's limitations.And like the stringed instruments, voices also became sharper, clearer, more focused. I had found what I was looking for regarding my classical music interests: a pair of headphones that while generally neutral (which some would consider to be 'flat' and flat has, I think, a negative connotation), are not at all boring or flat. I feel the music is more alive than ever in comparison to the Grado's.So... I also broke out some rock and alternative music (the recently remastered Led Zeppelin discs, some Nine Inch Nails and Pet Shop Boys) to see what the HD600's could do. Here I feared the Momentum would just kick butt thanks to the fuller bass, but I must say the HD600's continued to impress. All the good things they brought to mid and higher frequencies (clarity, precision) were still present, but, surprisingly, the bass was rock solid as well. I may hate myself for saying it, but I think the bass was a bit better. The upper-bass bloat in the Momentum's doesn't appear on the HD600's, which tends to make the lower-bass stand out more because they aren't overwhelmed by the enhanced upper-bass. I'd still say the Momentum's have more punch and who doesn't like that when listening to rock or alternative, but I could find myself readily using the HD600's just as often for The Smiths, The Cure, Skinny Puppy, etc. as I would the Momentum's.And here I think I have found a most excellent trio of headphones. Finding one perfect pair of headphones for all needs and opportunities is probably impossible. But I think I have accidentally stumbled upon a most excellent hat trick of cans that meet my various needs. I like to listen to music when I'm on the go; I have needs for portability. And while not truly the most portable of headphones, the Grado's for classical (and still quite reasonable for rock and alternative) and the Momentum's for rock and alternative (I confess I don't like them as much for classical as I do the Grado's for rock and alternative), AND the HD600's for more critical, at-home listening with audio equipment that has enough amplifier ooomph to properly push them.Add my name and voice to the long list of of folks who think, dollar for dollar, the Sennheiser HD600 are the best value in headphones out there.","Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2015",AH7NCDT3T23UBMREQ5NFPXIPXKCQ,True,124,

Technology has improved since this time. There's no sub-bass here. But I'm not taking a star away for that, even in 2024. These are legitimately 5 star headphones, even without low bass. I'm taking a star away for the position of each instrument in three dimensional space. In the two dimensions of height and width, they're pretty much perfect. In the dimension of depth, they come up lacking by one star. As an instrument goes up and down its scale, if you listen super carefully, you'll notice it goes further away and comes back up close. Not much, but a little.What you get in exchange for that perfect, three-dimensional picture is one of the most beautiful sounds in headphones to this day. It doesn't reach out and grab you by the throat and throw you to the ground and stomp on you until you admit how detailed and powerful they are. But they give you beautiful music. With the right classical recording, they can give you Majesty.An amazing value, and something every serious headphone hobbyist should have.","Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2024",AG43ZDUADVSQ7VCPCHYHPILVFUQQ,True,0,

R3JFX52QJE2107,B00004SY4H,4.0 out of 5 stars Detail at all costs,Tony,4,"If you're reading this, you're deep enough into the audio hobby to have realized an important psychological truth about yourself: you can't leave well enough alone. Neither can I. That's why, even after falling head over heels in love with the sound of the HD650, I ordered the HD600. I just had to know.The verdict? It's almost too close to call, but for my preferences the 650 is the better headphone. The two have been compared to death online, but if you have the capacity to think for yourself, audio review sites and forums are usually an unsavory if fascinating combination of shilling, self-justification, and ""follow the leader"" parroting of received opinions. Many self-proclaimed ""audiophiles"" have strong opinions about equipment they've never actually heard, which I can't accept.Given that, I decided the only way to compare the two headphones honestly was to listen to both myself for hours, going back and forth on a wide variety of recordings. The difference between a good recording and a bad recording dwarfs the difference between lossy and lossless, and the HD600 (more so than the HD650) may end up changing your taste in music because it makes good recordings sound SO GOOD and bad recordings sound SO BAD. In other words, it reveals the ""truth"" of the recording, and sometimes the truth hurts—it's really hard to enjoy The Killers now.The fact is that the 600 and 650 are ultimately more alike than different, and the popular insistence that they sound completely different has more to do with what Freud called ""the narcissism of small differences"" than the headphones themselves. If you Google some variation on ""HD650 vs HD600,"" you'll hear over and over that the 650 is ""bassier"" or ""darker."" Not really. There's actually very little difference across this parameter. Piano music presents an exception, but this is rarely what people think of as a bassy genre.There are two significant differences. The first is soundstage. The HD650's soundstage is wider, but that doesn't mean it can make a cramped recording sound airy. The HD600's soundstage is more intimate; there's less space between left and right channels, but it's not a huge difference, and I could see people preferring (or at least not minding) the HD600's tighter spacing.The most striking difference between the two headphones is in what I'd call ""smoothness."" The best analogy I can think of comes from digital photography. As an image sensor increases its sensitivity, it also increases its noise because you can't amplify a signal without also amplifying noise. There are two rival philosophies for dealing with noise: leave it as ""grain"" or smooth it out. Grain has its devotees, and the advantage of grain is that it preserves fine detail. The disadvantage is that past a certain point it becomes a distraction. The advantage of smoothness, meanwhile, is that it looks superficially nicer. The disadvantage is that when you look closely you won't see all the fine details. Like all things, it's a continuum of compromise. The 600 is the headphone to get if you value detail at the cost of an occasionally unpleasant grainy and even metallic quality to the sound. The 650 is the one to get if you care more about music than sound and don't care if your headphones sand down the sharp edges of your music a bit.Going back and forth between the two, it quickly becomes clear that the 650 is the stronger all-around performer: it sounds nicer on more recordings and across more genres. The 600, meanwhile, is the champion of a particular niche: good recordings with lots of micro detail. Want to be able to count how many times the skin of a drum reverberates after it's struck? Want to hear such fine vocal gradations you'll know how a singer felt during recording? The 600 is for you.Make no mistake: at its best, the 600 produces the most astonishingly detailed sound I've ever heard. Unfortunately, at its worst it sounds grainy, jumbled, and not particularly musical. I'm sorry to report that piano music sounds particularly off on the 600: low frequencies disappear and take the fullness of the keys with them. Vocals can sound oddly recessed, even far away. In general, the 600 seems to fare better with female vocals than male ones, and with strings over pianos. It's absolutely glorious for acoustic guitar, but then, so is the 650.The 650's great advantage lies in its ability to bring out vocals like a spotlight. They stand out so clearly and powerfully from the instrumentation that you'll feel like you're hearing your favorite songs for the first time. The effect is really quite incredible: it's like there's a special sonic space reserved for vocals and unpolluted by other sounds. Based on Sennheiser's own specs, the 650 has lower distortion than the 600 and it's clearly a more refined driver unit. Whatever the technical reason, the 650's background is pitch black: sounds rise from and fall back into a sea of silence. Be forewarned: a well-recorded vocal track through the 650 may bring tears to your eyes, and that's why I kept the 650 and returned the 600.Finally, let's talk about measurements. While there's a valid SUBJECTIVE argument for preferring the sound of the 600, the 650 has an objectively better driver that improves on its predecessor in every way: higher sensitivity, lower distortion, and better power handling. Here are the figures straight from Sennheiser's manuals, which you can find for yourself on the product pages for both headphones at bhphotovideo[dot]com. The terminology used isn't consistent from one manual to the other, but the parameters in question are the same. I've noted these variations where applicable.Frequency response (-10db): 12 – 38,000 Hz (HD600), 10 – 39,500 Hz (HD650)Impedance: 300 ohms (same for both)Sensitivity/""Loudness"" (Sennheiser also calls this ""Sound pressure level at 1 kHz""): 97 dB (HD600), 103 dB (HD650)Load rating (Sennheiser also calls this ""Long-term max. input power""): 0.2W aka 200mW (HD600), 500mW (HD650)THD (Total Harmonic Distortion): ≤0.1% (HD600), ≤0.05% (HD650)In short, the HD650 will get louder than the 600 because it has higher sensitivity at the same resistance. The fact that it can handle almost twice as much INPUT power is a positive, not a negative; if you turned a decent amp ALL THE WAY UP with the HD600 connected, you could damage or even destroy the drivers. The 650 has enough headroom for more than twice as much input power, but there's little point in driving your headphones loud enough for permanent hearing loss.At the end of the day, headphone preference, like any preference, is primarily subjective, and I can't seriously imagine anyone being unhappy with the HD600.","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2017",AFKDMTAWMFUK24VY2FOISR3IDJYQ,True,400,

R3RH4BRUCN1O46,B00004SY4H,"4.0 out of 5 stars The ""jack of all trades"" set of headphones?",Tom Servo,4,"I've been shopping for some new headphones now for nearly a year to replace my aging Sennheiser HD 525s that I probably bought close to 20 years ago. They've been quite the faithful set of cans, but replacement parts have gotten impossible to find. First Sennheiser quit selling the replacement ear pads, then the headband was discontinued, then their replacement cables got really expensive. So it was time to look for a new set to hopefully get me another 20 years of headphone-y bliss.Although I seriously considered jumping to another brand, I wound up coming back to Sennheiser based mostly on the reviews of these headphones here and on some other sites. I really prefer a well balanced sound over the bass-heavy ""urban"" style or treble-heavy sound of some other styles like Grados and AKGs. Plus, having prior experience with a similar model of headphones, I kind of knew what to expect, with both the good and bad points.First point I gotta make has nothing to do with fidelity. Dang, these are some ugly looking 'phones! They are nicer in person than the pictures convey, but still not something people will compliment you on for having good taste. Luckily, looks mean nothing when it comes to sound quality. Frankly, I'd rather look kinda dorky but smile every time I hear my music than look ""cool"" but grumble at a flawed set of headphones.Second, the build quality as new seems on par with the current asking price, but I do wonder about long term longevity since the plastic, while thick, feels kind of brittle. My old HD 525s were mostly well taken care, a few ""oopsie"" moments aside, and have held up well. But they're also pretty flexible, which this HD 600 set does not seem to be at all. Hopefully it'll loosen up a little over time. That will also help with the fit; right now they are a bit on the tight size for my slightly larger-than-average sized melon.The best I can say as a non-audiophile is that these are at least on par with my previous Sennheisers. They do seem to offer tight, clean (but not over-emphasized) bass and clean mids and highs. My hearing is a bit… wonky, though, so even with good headphones I need an EQ to ""clean up"" some of the oddities. Rather than have a hearing curve that peaks around human speech frequencies like normal ears, mine starts off below human speech with mild loss, then grows more and more sensitive until it goes literally off the charts in the high frequency range. In fact, in a test setting I peaked at around 22 kHz at the age of 25, although age has surely taken some of that high-high end ability away. It still leaves me with a massive peak around 6-8 kHz, which I have to EQ out when I can, otherwise I get headaches with treble-heavy music.The old HD 525's I had required about a -4 dB drop on the EQ at the 4 and 8 kHz bands. These require about a -6 dB drop, which is a noticeable difference to me, so I suppose they are brighter than the old set, but only by a bit. (By contrast, a cheaper set of JVC headphones I tried recently required -12 dB, the maximum the EQ could do, and still caused me to get a headache after a few minutes of rock music listening at a moderate volume level.)I realize this information is of zero use to everyone, but it felt good to at least explain why I even need an EQ in the first place, since they're rare as hen's teeth in modern audio systems!So far I've only been able to find two real complaints. Because they are so stiff, they clamp down on my large melon of a head quite a bit more than the old set did. Thankfully, they are still surprisingly comfortable due to the velvety soft ear cushions. Here's hoping Sennheiser doesn't discontinue selling replacement ones any time soon!The other complaint is while listening to one particular song I did encounter some buzzing from the left channel during a passage with a pretty loud mid-bass range audio section. It was likely just the particular timber of the sound itself and I haven't been able to replicate the buzz with other music yet, but it did give me a second of pause, wondering if something was loose internally already. My HD 525s buzz and rattle like an old Chevy on a gravel road, but they didn't start doing that until just a few years ago.Overall, I think these may be the perfect ""jack of all trades"" headphones. They're not perfect for hip-hop or rap or bass-heavy electronic music necessarily, nor will they satisfy those who crave a brilliant bright high end for classical music. But for everyone else, be they fans of rock, pop, jazz, country, folk, blues or — heaven forbid — even polkas, these may be the best headphones can by for the money.","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2017",AHX2XBRUV3O2GLEVOOR5PT4V7YDQ,True,5,

The sound is warm and relaxing.In my opinion, any grado headphone will offer more detail and you can use them without an amp.Some may find the old fashioned design and not perfect build quality a turn off but if your goalIs finding a musical slightly bright headphone with high detail, go with grado.I think I'm just a bit disappointed from the hype of the hd600. It's a quality set, just not $400 quality.24 hr update...After stretching these out on some books overnight, the fit was way better. Caution:Plastic band could break. Only stretch 1 to 2 inches wider than your head.As for sound quality, My initial review above was using a solid state amp.I moved up to my bedroom tube amplifier.At least a 30% improvement.The vocals are great, sound stage improved and it sounded much fuller.Final verdict, still 4 stars.

R1FIJMRCVGR11T,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely Fantastic!,BKarno,5,"It would seem that my review has turned out to be a sort of comparison of the Sennheiser HD 598s to the HD 600s. While it wasn't where I intended to go, I think the comparison is valid when deciding if the $200 premium is worth the payout (it is).I have owned/auditioned a ton of headphones over the years, and I currently have a pretty decent assortment in my stable. But these HD 600s are probably going to have all those other pairs collecting dust. About a month ago I had purchased a pair of HD 598s and they were the pair of cans that finally sold me on open phones. I really like the 598s, and they are excellent for classical, jazz, classic rock, and many other genres music. However, when it came to listening to contemporary popular music they just seemed to come up short. The HD 600s are a much better ""all around"" headphone, and well worth the additional $200 (in my opinion). Their superiority was evident from the moment I put them on and plugged them in. I played Chris Isaac's ""Wicked Game"" and I literally had a chill run up my spine. More bass than the 598s? Yes; but it's not unnatural in any way whatsoever. It just adds to the richness/quality of the overall sound. These make everything just sound more real, and they seem to do it almost effortlessly. After listening to the 600s for an extended period and then going back to the 598's, the differences become more noticeable. Again, where the 598s start to struggle, the 600s just power through. I completely understand why so many people consider these to be some of the best phones ever produced. I have also been tricked into looking around the room for that noise I just heard only to realize it was part of the recording. If you need to stick to a budget, the 598s are an excellent choice and a fantastic bargain (just watch and wait for the price to dip). However, if you can afford the premium price, the HD 600s are worth every penny.My listening setup consists of a variety of digital files played from my computer, an Onkyo C-7030 CD player, and a Nuforce Icon DAC/Headphone Amp. I should also add that I don't use any equalization with my phones. I messed around running the phones directly off the computer's headphone jack, and I have to say that I highly recommend a good DAC/Amp to get the most out of these cans, as the added power really brings them to life. And remember that to truly ""Listen"" to these phones you need to be in a quiet environment.A few other observations: The 600's clamp quite a bit tighter than the 598s, though they do seem to be loosening up a bit with use. I think the 598s actually sound a bit wider and a touch brighter, but my 600's only have about 15 hours on them at this writing and like the 598s, I expect them to open up after more time. I may invest in a better cable in the future, but the included cable gets the job done, and it's more flexible than the one for the 598's (which I also replaced). I had thought about comparing these to some of my other closed phones for my review, but really, I don't feel that any of them even comes close to these 600s. I've also noticed that with the 598's it is important to find that sweet spot in the volume where the sound really starts to shine, while the 600's play much better and more balanced over a wider range of volume (high and low).I am looking forward to enjoying these headphones for many years to come. If you have any comments or questions I welcome them and will try my best to answer. I did extensive research prior to this purchase, so if I can't answer a specific question I may be able to point you in the right direction.Update 1: After probably 20 more hours of listening I can clarify my comment about the 598s being a little bit brighter. On certain pieces when I hear a high-hat cymbal on the 598's, I hear it as one sound, and mostly the sound of the cymbal. On the 600's you clearly hear the stick hitting the cymbal, and the sound of the cymbal itself. So, I would say the high end of the 600s may not be perceived as being as bright as the 598's, but it is much more defined, clear, and controlled.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2014",AEI27URBWEHBGVRODR74ZL4LPGQQ,True,30,

R23O3BQQ64E0Q7,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars These are great...GREAT headphones.,John Smith,5,"I'm generally of the opinion that the word ""classic"" gets thrown around too often in the world of headphones, but I have to say, for as old and storied as the Sennheiser HD600's are, they truly embody the title in every way possible. As far as ""mid-fi"" headphones go, I don't look to any other can out there, and to tell the truth they're actually my most used pair of headphones simply because the sound signature is so appealing and easy to listen to and appreciate.Sound:Obviously this is the most important aspect of headphones past a certain price point, and as I said, the HD600's don't disappoint in any discernible way. Sure, you're going to get better clarity and imaging as you go up in price, but for what they are, the HD600's have a truly outstanding sound signature.Highs are dark to the point that some would say they suffer from the infamous ""Sennheiser veil,"" but that term honestly means less and less to me everyday I use these. The highs are about as articulate and detailed as you're going to get at this price point, only they're not ""up front"" like you hear from the likes of Beyerdynamics, so there are never any bursts of shrillness from the likes of cymbals and hi-hats. For the longest time, the promise of ""darkness"" from these cans scared me away, but I have to say, it's hard to listen to brighter headphones after hearing these. It's all of the detail without any of the bite.Mids are perhaps slightly overextended, especially on the higher end of the mid-range spectrum, but not to the point of sounding unnatural. Just to the point of becoming a preferential option when considering different headphones. Overdriven guitars sound especially fantastic. As a testament to their greatness, I actually disliked the Black Keys until I heard ""Gold on the Ceiling"" through these.Lows are in keeping with the ""neutral"" sound of the HD600's. They never overpower anything, but they're there when they're supposed to be, and focused and tight to boot. Considering their open design, I have no complaints with the lows whatsoever, especially coming off more bass-anemic cans like the AKG Q701's. Obviously they are not basshead cans, but they still deliver what they need to.The soundstage is wonderful as well. It's not as wide as the Q701's (though to be fair, that's the widest I've ever heard), but it's natural, airy and articulate enough to create a very pleasant stage overall.Also, it's probably obvious if you're looking to spend this much on headphones, but a good headphone amp REALLY brings these alive. They are actually surprisingly easy to drive, but a good amp and DAC really makeComfort:No need to spend too much time here. These are Sennheiser headphones. They're most likely going to be some of the most comfortable headphones you ever put on your head. Though I will say that these in particular need a little ""bend-in"" time to really get comfy. Everything is padded very well, but the clamping force right out of the box is slightly too strong, but thankfully becomes a non-issue after ten or so hours of use.Build Quality/Features:""Features"" isn't really a strong suit of most Sennheiser headphones (not that that's a particularly bad thing), so I'll just say feature-wise, they terminate in a 3.5mm plug and come with a 1/4"" adapter that fits nicely over the 3.5mm. That's about it, honestly.The build quality is great, though they are a bit more plastic-y than I would like. Other than that, I have no complaints here either. The velour pads are affixed nicely to the cups, the aluminum lining in the headband seems very sturdy, and even the plastic itself feels at least high quality and hearty. Also, it's worth noting that the binding method on the headband is totally different from Sennheiser's lesser HD models, so that infamous ""headband cracking"" you seen occasionally on the 598's, 595's and 555's is non-existent in these.Conclusion:I can't recommend these enough. They will most likely be an outstanding step up from whatever you're upgrading from. Some of my favorite headphones ever.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2013",AFI747TFGOVRRHM32BYFGDIQWR5Q,True,3,
R2AR58ISBH3VWK,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars Hearing What the Artist Intended,BigDaddyNC,5,"If hearing what the artist intended to put into their recordings is important to you, you need equipment that can squeeze those details out of the recordings. These cans could be one important (maybe the most important) component of a system that can do that.What the HD600's do well is that they don't exaggerate any part of the sonic spectrum -- part of what this means is that if you are a ""bass head"" you may wish to look elsewhere. If there is lots of bass in the source material, you'll hear it cleanly and clearly. If it ain't there, you won't hear it.These are over-ear, open headphones. That means that they totally surround your ear, and that the ear cups are not sealed. If you turn up your music enough (and it doesn't have to be much), other people can hear what you are listening to, albeit not as loudly or clearly as you can.If you intend to use these cans in an open office environment, or to listen to music on a plane -- you've got the wrong product. You'll need closed cans or in-ear monitors, or something with noise cancellation -- and you have lots of great options.If you intend to use these cans in a relatively quiet place where sound leakage isn't going to bother anyone else -- now we're cooking with gas!But that's not all. If you plan on listening to your music off a phone or other portable device, the device won't likely be able to get your music to listenable levels. You will require some sort of headphone amplifier to get the most of these. In most circumstances, you will want a dedicated headphone amplifier for these. I use a Schiit Fulla 2 as a combination DAC (digital/analog converter) and amplifier connected either to my Mac Mini or iPhone 7.But wait...we ain't done yet. If you are listening to digital media, you will want to make sure that your music is encoded with sufficient quality. 128kbps mp3's may not sound any better on HD600's as compared to a lesser headphone. So, make sure your compressed music is 256kbps AIFF (the Apple format) or 320kbps mp3. Better yet -- encode your music in either Apple Lossless or FLAC (free lossless audio codec) so you can get the most out of your source material.What do Sennheiser HD600's give you that lesser headphones don't? Clarity. Detail. A sense of space -- a feeling that you are in the room with the musicians making the music and can hear the voices and instruments separately and maybe even from different positions around you.If I compare these to the Sennheiser Momentum (over ear, first generation) I hear details like background vocals that are buried deep in the mix, or subtle guitar accents, the mechanical clicking of of the keys while the flute player plays a soft passage, or a singer taking a breath before the next phrase. The Momentums are great cans in their own right and can even catch some of these details, and phones and other portable devices can drive them without the aid of amplifier, but imagine that they are a pair of filtered eyeglasses that can see thousands of colors -- and that the HD600's are filtered eyeglasses that can see millions of colors -- the differences are subtle if the ""sonic colors"" are present in front of you and that you are capable of hearing them -- you can see that hyper-intelligent shade of blue with the HD600's, but it just shows up as some indefinitely pleasant shade of blue with the Momentums. An exaggeration perhaps, but hopefully it gets the point across.Bottom line, if you have the device/amplifier to drive them, the right place to listen to them, and music that is sufficiently well-encoded you will have the tools to appreciate what the HD600's have to offer. Are HD600's the best? Probably not, but you will be hard-pressed to do better without dropping a lot more coin.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2017",AHWIRA5UPB5WBDUAVLOUTKA7IRXA,True,40,

These now come with the same earpads as the HD 660 series which is stiffer and deeper but not as wide nor do they have the slightly angled interior side. The new pads cause them to have a bit different sound but it's a good improvement I think so it is worthwhile as well having more space if you have big ears. These are still one of the clearest and most even sounding headphones, even having the newer 660S and S2 as well as the 2000 dollar ADX5000 set the old HD 600s I have are still my favourite set. Having the others adds some variety but if you just want one set of headphones to stick with these are the ones to get in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2024",AEGSUFCRE5L5V66JYTVT5YMQTZHQ,True,2,
RWZSN05V27KJN,B00004SY4H,"3.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing treble extension and resolution - Do they really need time to ""break in""?",MIKE,3,"Had to replace a set of Q-701s from AKG, didn’t want to purchase them again since they moved production of that model to China. So, based on reviews, I decided on the HD600 over the HD650, the latter of which is supposedly too warm sounding with rolled off or veiled treble response.I’m not a headphone expert, though I have been using them in one form or another dating back to 1977, so a good 40 years on everything from the old Koss white eggshell looking things to Sony’s 1980s on the ear to noise canceling Sony and Bose phones. But for music (hi-fi) my AKGs had been my reference until they were damaged. But this review concerns some AKG K-712s that I purchased at the same time as the Sennheisers specifically to test. In truth I picked up the AKGs after being disappointed with the HD600s; feeling like something was missing.The AKGs are a lot more resolving and provide a lot of space and air around the music, instruments are well separated, while the HD600s are a bit more congested and there isn't a good amount of resolution between or of the various instruments - and it's due a hard to pin down bloat in the upper bass and the roll-off in the upper treble. So the highs are also slightly rolled off in the 13kHz region and above. The K-712s (like the Q-701s) impart upon the music a non-rushed, easy to pick apart, breezy easiness. Now that I can compare them side by side, the Sennheisers definitely also have slightly bloated, bloomy bass, which tends to interfere with the rest of the music.Comfort for the HD600s is GOOD – definitely above average from what I’ve tried on but build quality of materials and craftsmanship is just so-so. As others have noted, there are some joints that look and feel pretty easy to break. They are about on par with the AKG-712s both in comfort and build, and neither of them are particularly impressive for the price, especially full retail. I think the AKGs are probably going to be more durable under most situations just due to the design having fewer plastic moving parts. Both companies should have used some light metal alloys and the quality/look and feel would have improved immensely. There is no excuse for this level of plastic at this price point from AKG or Sennheiser. Spare me the fancy boxing and literature and put that money into the physical attributes of the products. The Sennheisers are more comfortable on my medium sized head than the AKGs. My previous AKG Q-701s seemed to fit tighter, the K-712s are looser and feel like they might fall off. There isn't enough tension in the support apparatus.The Sennheisers do more than just feel comfortable....they sound comfortable. Lush and enveloping, even if slightly congested or claustrophobic. Don’t get me wrong – those adjectives seem negative, but they’re only used in comparison to the AKGs, which approximate planar or ribbon drivers in the space and general relaxed, airy quality and true to the music as it was recorded or mastered. In a vacuum or if all I had the ability to ever use was the HD600s, I could convince myself that I’m satisfied. It’s just that with the AKGs I can pinpoint each instrument in the mix, spatially and tonally. These are critical listening headphones and the HD600s are comfortable listening session headphones. I suppose in some listeners the AKGs could get fatiguing, but not with decent source material or a good headphone amp. Rather, your ears get used to them and you start appreciating their finesse, space and easy-goingness. I would bet that to most peoples’ ears these will sound like very similar headphones. The presentation, maybe voicing, is not that different between the two – other than the bass and upper treble. On some tracks indeed they could be indistinguishable. That says bad things to me about the HD650 which everyone seems to say are veiled in the high registers. If they’re more veiled than the 600s, then I couldn’t think of any use for them personally. But if I was at the store and comparing the HD600s and K-712s on the same amp and source material, I again can think of some songs where there isn’t enough of a difference between the two to matter. Point being, if you’re spending $300+ on a pair of “reference” headphones, you would be well-served to compare a few models on a longer timescale than a simple trip to Best Buy.I guess the verdict is that neither of these look or feel like $350 headphones (much less their $400+ retail prices), but both sound adequate for most uses, so I’d advise you to try before you buy. And getting away from the specific impressions of the various frequency bands or ""musicality"" my overwhelming impression is that I'd rather buy an album from someone who mastered it on the AKGs than on the Sennheisers. I'd rather do mastering on the AKGs. In summary, I’m sticking with the AKGs and sending back the Sennheisers.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2018",AHCPGGY2A6RPCP343CBTT3SLSOBQ,True,26,

Issue being if they fall or otherwise place stress on the cable the connection may break and if that happens the cable has to be replaced. The stress connections are very flimsy. If the cable has to be removed for any reason there is little plastic that sticks out to grab on, so likely the cable itself gets pulled which can break the wires.

R3UY9QRHFN2FK0,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent sound,Ian,5,"Excellent sound and clarity. A big step up from the HD 280, HD 380, and HD 599 I've used previously. Well worth the the price tag if you care about your sound.I don't need to EQ these at all for 98% of songs, but sometimes I turn up the lower end very slightly and turn down the upper end very slightly. I listen to EDM, Rock, and Jazz and they sound great for all. I've read that some people don't like the bass for EDM, but it sounds fine. They're headphones, not a subwoofer strapped to your head.You don't NEED an amp to drive these volume wise, but if you want better sound it could help depending on what your setup is. My motherboard has a Realtek ALC1220, which I feed to a mixer that drives these. If I plug them directly into the motherboard they are LOUD, but they could have distortion which an amp could fix. If you don't have the money for a separate amp and you have a decent audio chip in your PC then don't worry about it. Really.These are fairly high impedance so I don't hear the noise interference from my GPU or mouse that I used to hear from lower impedance headphones, but this is true for any high(er) impedance headphones.I've seen some people talk about a strong clamping force which I haven't experienced. They ""clamp"" tighter than some other closed/open back headphones, such as the HD599, but it's not painful or uncomfortable to me, even while wearing them for hours. But, I have worn headphones daily for years so I'm used to it. This gets better as they're broken in as well.Noise cancellation is non-existent; they're open back headphones. Leakage is not too bad, but you can definitely hear them in the proximity of someone wearing them.Build quality seems solid enough, but we'll see how long they last. I haven't read any complaints about build quality anyway so I'm not worried about it.Overall I'm very impressed.

If you want to mix or master music these will be a reliable tool for a very long time. If you want a “fun” listening experience, you may want to look for something with more bass. These headphones roll off pretty hard in the sub bass region so they don’t have much impact. Sure you can eq these easily with a bass shelf under 150, but eq can’t fix it entirely. It can only amplify the already weak bass. If you want a warm fun sound signature, look at something like the Hifiman Sundara.

R1X9YSQHEDJ876,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars Still a classic,onebigunion,5,"Years a go I owned the predecessor to this phone, the HD580. I got away from headphones and eventually sold it, after several years of enjoyment. Senn has been selling the 600 and 650 at very reasonable prices lately, and since I'm back into headphones again, I decdieded to give them another try.The 600 is sometimes regarded as the more neutral phone when compared to the bassier HD650. I've never heard the 650, but as I like a lot of detail and linear treble quantity and extension, I decided on the 600. Senn has made a few improvements to the drivers since the old 580 days. The sound is different than I remember the 580's. There is definitely more treble energy, and a little more energy in the presence range compared to the old 580.There are plenty of reasons this headphone is considered a classic and the favorite of many. Sound is very balanced and detailed. No frequency range is emphasized. the soundstage, even driven from JDS Labs portable O2 amp, is remarkable, and three dimensional. Instrument separation is fantastic - if its in the recording, you WILL hear it. Bass is punchy but doesn't not extend deeply into the sub bass. It begins to roll off fairly quickly below about 60 hz. This is one area where other headphones, including the HD650, outperform the 600.Vocals are clear and crisp, aided by the linear extension of the presence range up to about 4000hz. The upper treble has some sparkle and air, but is never harsh. It is an improvement over the old 580.Build quality is acceptable. You might expect less plastic at this price, but the trade-off is that the headphone is completely modular. Any part, including the driver that would ever need to be replaced can be done easily, with no tools other than maybe a small screwdriver. Comfort level is superb. Clamping force, on my small-medium head is just right, not too loose and not a vice grip. Combined with the 600's light weight and plush and soft earpads, which have plenty of room for my largeish ears, and these can be worn for hours at a time with no discomfort.The 600's scale well with better source and amplification. Driven from my Bryston pre-amp, with a highis 120 ohm output impedance, these seem to come even more alive. Perhaps its just the much larger voltage swing the Bryston can provide compared to the 02, but the bass is tighter and more powerful with more extension and even better soundstage.An amp is definitely recommended, but even my Sansa Clip + , with 0.5V output is capable of driving them to (barely) acceptable volume. But really, invest in an emp to getthe most out of these.Overall, a comfortable great-sounding headphone. It immerses you in the music, and you just forget about the equipment and enjoy. There are likely more detailed phones out there, but these are no slouch in that area. I need a detailed phone in order to really get into the music. the airy treble contributes to the lovely soundstage, but is never sibilant (unless the recording is, even then I think the 600 is a little forgiving).At a price of about 300, its hard not to justify this purchase. Because of its modularity, you can own these for many years, as long as Senn continues to have parts available. The model has been around for about 20 years, and it might be around for another 20.Hats off to a classic, great sounding, comfortable all-rounder headphone.","Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2015",AHRXQZWBJTGSTEI5CNQDC6MWAHXA,True,2,
R273JOBY250MZM,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars A Story of How Source Matters,Johnny Truong,5,"EDIT 9-20-12:I'm now using these headphones with the Dragonfly DAC/amp and the sound quality just shot up by a WIDE margin! The Dragonfly does wonders for the HD600. I highly recommend the Dragonfly as a source over the Essence STX and receiver.Happy listening!Original Review:I've had the HD600 for about a month now and was initially unimpressed with the sound coming out of it.I have the ASUS Essence STX soundcard (a music lover's soundcard with built-in headphone amp) and hooked the HD600 up to it thinking it would do a good job of driving the headphone like it did for my AGK K702. The AGK K701/K702 are often compared to Sennheiser's HD600/650 for good reason; they both fall into the same price range (well...used to) and sound great in their own ways. At first glance, the ASUS soundcard seemed to be doing a decent job of driving the HD600. Volume was never an issue and clarity seemed good, although it wasn't as clear as the K702. Unfortunately, the soundstage was a lot smaller than the K702 (this was expected) and seemingly more narrow (tunnel vision like) but it was bigger than the HD598 by a slight margin.I then tried to burn-in the headphones to see if it would make a difference. (I believe in burn-in since there was a noticeable difference when I burned in the K702) After about 50 hours of burn-in and regular usage, there was hardly any detectable sound difference from the 0 hour state. I'm not going to rule out the possibility the HD600 needing additional burn-in time and may update the review to reflect the changes.The next step was changing the stock cable to that of the HD650, as was advised by many reviewers here. The HD650 stock cable is much thicker and durable than the HD600 stock cable. Did it make a difference in sound quality? It did sound better, but barely. It's a cheap upgrade and probably worth having even if it didn't affect the sound.At this point:ASUS Essence STX + K702 = large soundstage, high clarity, low bass presence, great treble and vocalsASUS Essence STX + HD600 = narrow soundstage, decent clarity, great bass presence, good treble and vocalsI was ready give it 4 stars as I still preferred the AKG K702 and thought it sounded better in all regards except bass.Then I decided to hook this up to my high end Pioneer Elite receiver. What changed? A LOT!!!The soundstage got bigger and was much wider (although not as big as the K702's) Front positioned vocalists and instruments no longer sounded like they were in my face; they were pushed a little further back, making them sound more laid back. The clarity shot up in quality to rival the AKG K702, making it sound less veiled than before. I didn't think the receiver would make this much of a difference, since it only made slight sound improvements for the K702, but it did!Reciever + HD600 = large soundstage, high clarity, great bass, treble, vocals, everythingWith this set up, the HD600s are indeed 5 star material.Does it sound better than the K702?For songs in most genres, yes. For classical, choirs, orchestra or anything else that takes place in a spacious auditorium, no.Overall, the AGK K702 sound great with the ASUS Essence STX and receiver. The HD600 does not pair up to the soundcard as well and required the receiver to sound great. Just another example of how your experience will depend on whether or not your headphones pair up well with your arsenal of amp/soundcard/receiver/anything-but-an-ipod.","Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2011",AEYQCKQZVFSMU2FPATCLZSKM24JQ,True,10,
RET3NXD4PAWM4,B00004SY4H,3.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser HD600 Headphone Review:,Max,3,"For quite some time I was curious as to what was truly out there when it came to good headphones. Being interested in upgrading from my Audio Technica ath-m50 headphones I scoured the web for information on headphones reading numerous reviews and comparisons. The hd600 came up relatively often and was praised for its great value, neutral sound, ability to handle near any genre, and comfort. Seeing it available at $300 down from $400 like new, I convinced myself to go for it.The wait for it to arrive could not go fast enough and amazingly enough this was the first time I have had a product arrive before the estimated delivery date. Finally it was time to spend some time getting used to my new headphones and sizing them up. What I found was really quite surprising.The bass was the most obvious difference right off the bat. Coming from the m50's which are supposedly bass heavy and ""v shaped"" in their sound signature I expected the bass to take a back seat with these headphones. Nearly all comments I have heard on bass about the hd600 described it as light, or neutral, most certainly not the bass-head's headphone. At least for me, the low end sounds very present and well represented. Actually for the first time in some tracks I felt like I could properly hear the previously washed out bass line. If this is what bass neutral sounds like I can only imagine the slam in a bass heavy headphone.The mid-range is slightly fuller and clearer but I would not say the difference is night and day. As for the treble I notice the least amount of difference. I can say for certain that harsh highs or sibilance are practically non-existent provided the source is not overly so to begin with.The deciding factor on me choosing an open backed headphone was my desire for a greater sense of space, an effect I so often hear described by reviewers. To my disappointment the hd600 appears to be lacking in this department almost severely. Switching back and forth between my closed pair and these reveals no significant difference in sense of space. I did account for difference in recordings thinking that maybe I am simply not listening to music that demonstrates an impressive soundstage. After listening to some binaural and spacious recordings I have concluded the soundstage is indeed minimal.With these headphones being open I was concerned about their leaking of sound perhaps to the point of annoying others in the same room. Thankfully it is far less an issue than I anticipated. For an accurate comparison, play your music of choice (a little louder than you would normally listen) on some closed headphones with them off your head and point the cups outward. What you hear will be pretty close to these.Something odd I discovered is that these headphones actually sound louder than my m50's with the same exact volume level. I have no idea why this is as both the hd600's sensitivity rating and ohm rating are greater than the m50's. I am using these headphones with only my onboard sound on my pc. I was prepared to buy an amplifier to go with them, but I find I get ample volume even with the quietest of tracks. If anyone has any critical comparison experience of these headphones with a stronger amplifier and its effect on the sound I would love to hear about it.The comfort on these headphones is fairly mediocre. The pads could stand to be much softer and roomier. Unexpanded the headphones are very small, but they expand quite a lot, more than I could ever see someone needing. The clamp is strong out of the box, so much so if you need to move around for some reason while wearing these they will not be going anywhere. The clamp can be lessened by fully extending the bands and bending just the exposed metal. Bending the plastic along with it would probably cause it to break. Speaking of general build quality and aesthetics, these headphones are not bad at all. They do not exude class or luxury like some others in the same price range, but they are well put together and look great in my opinion. The weakest point is the swivel on the cups. They feel loose and not sturdily attached. The cable included is very thin and does not seem to be of very high quality. I like a thin and light cable myself but if you would like an upgrade, the hd650 cable looks much beefier.I am faced with a dilemma. I do enjoy these headphones, but do I feel they offer $300 worth of improvement, even spread over their lifetime? I would say no. at the full price of $400 I would strongly suggest trying out headphones in person and consider what things are most important to you in a headphone. At this price point, I feel a high end experience can be expected in all aspects of form and function.In conclusion, the merits of the hd600's are seemingly substantially over exaggerated. This is not to take away from their solid performance, but until these headphones reach a price point of $200-$250 I suspect there are better choices available.Edit: Due to concerns about me not evaluating the hd600 with proper amplification, please take my comments about sound quality with that in mind.Edit Part 2: It has been quite awhile but I can now update this review after having purchased an O2 headphone amplifier. My findings are on the unfortunate side, as It seems I can't hear any discernible difference in sound quality using the headphones from my onboard sound v.s my headphone amplifier. I once again tried using them with my Iphone 4 and compared with the amp, but the results were the same. This goes completely against what I've been told countless times, leading me to believe expectation bias for audio must be incredibly powerful.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2014",AFEDC6M443TDUMJLLNCU5MQMUFUA,True,24,
R3NZP705ZAOQR8,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply the best frequency response I have heard in a headphone.,Karen Range,5,"These headphones are a testimony to the phrase ""old is gold"". Despite being 25 years old, these cans still produce the best natural frequency response and timbre that I have heard out of any headphone, and I have owned alot of headphones. Here are just some of the models I have owned previously. Focal Clear, Focal Elex, HiFiMan Ananda, Sundara, HE-4XX, HE-5XX, HE-400i, Sennheiser HD560S, HD599, Phillips X2HR, Phillips SHP 9500, DCA ÆON Closed X, DCA ÆON Open X, Monoprice M570, ATH-M50X, Beyer DT990 Premium, Fostex T50RP, Fostex Dekoni Blue, and many more. I have also demoed cans such as the ATH-R70X, Avantone Planar, AKG K712, K612, Beyer DT1990 Pro and many more.The single fault that I can find with this headphone's frequency response is the lack of proper bass extension. It rolls off around 5db or so after 80hz. This is very easily fixed by EQ though. The only other fault I can find is the imaging/staging performance. The staging is very intimate and tight (which I like, personal preference kind of thing) but the imaging is a bit more vague then something like the Focal Clear. Overall though, it's imaging is not bad, just not good either.Out of everything I have heard, these sound the most natural and correct in tone and timbre. It is simply incredible. The only other audio device I have heard that matches the HD600 in frequency response is the Etymotic ER2SE/XR. I vastly prefer the HD600's FR to things such as the Focal Clear and HiFiMan Ananda. It's timbre is also far superior to those two models. Everything from voices to instruments to the sloshing of water in the background of a mix sounds extremely natural and true to life.I personally think the HD600 is the best starting and stopping point in HiFi headphones. It's leagues ahead of typical consumer headphones and hangs or even exceeds multi-thousand dollar pairs in frequency response and timbre. I have personally sold all of my other headphones besides the HD600, it's that good. These are a tried and tested design that will last you years, unlike many other competitors around this price. *cough* HiFiMan *cough*My only other complaint is the comfort. Clamp is high out of the box but that is fixable. The earpads are a bit shallow and my ears do touch the interior foam. This can get uncomfortable after a while.I cannot recommend this headphone enough. Give it a try, you won't regret it.","Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2022",AHF7LBXSFX4LW3FG3CK572HKQMRA,True,12,

My most recent headphones were just the AirPods Pro.The HD600 stands up and sounds amazing.The first things that stood out to me was how much noise I could hear through the headphones while wearing them. These were my first open back set of audio equipment I have owned and you can hear everything going on around you. This works great for me as I just work at home and don’t want to ignore my family. While music/audio is playing you don’t notice the fact that you can hear things around you anyways.The second thing was how much bleed there was. Re the first point I had never had an open back set of headphones. Again this is a non issue for me as I only use them in the home, but they definitely bleed audio.The first week of wearing them was also difficult since the clamp pressure was so tight. (My SO loves the pressure though so to each their own). They loosened up and are very comfortable now.I have no ear for audiophile headphones but I do know these sound great! The largest complaint I’ve read is the base on the HD600 but I find it to be perfectly adequate and haven’t even noticed a change from my daily drivers.I do not have an amp as of yet and not sure if I will get one. I plug the headphones directly into my motherboard on my computer and have had no issues with quality (that I can tell) or volume.Great headphones, highly recommended.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2023",AGEGBM23IMUFCXSSZ4BTXWFELL5A,True,1,

But you can plug a DAC into the phone and get a great sound. But the source must be good. Tidal and QBuz have very high quality bitrates and offer very good prices if streaming.

R14BMYL0DLRHCU,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars So happy,Rosetta,5,"TLDRPROS comfortable, great sound, and exciting to play with for those interested in audioCONS I think the price IS justifiable, but these are more a luxury than must have. The cords coming with each side mean I have to take them off with a bit more care, but that's a me problem.I've had my eyes on these for years, but couldn't justify paying $400+ for headphones no matter how nice. I've had two other Sennheisers before, a 200 series and 500 series, and both still work, but I'd heard so much about this model.I don't have anything fancy yet, just a halfway decent sound card on my PC, so I may revisit this review. Compared to my Sennhesier 560s, to an amateur like me, the differences aren't huge. The bass is less ""booming"" on the 600s, but I didn't feel I lost anything in songs. Where I did notice the difference was more mid and high range sounds, particularly the sound of cymbals. On some songs it was almost like hearing the song again for the first time.These things are stated if you research, but no active noise cancelling on these. If you're listening loudly enough people will hear. For the bass lovers, I think these are just fine, but they don't thump the bass like others I've had, so if that's super important to you there are probably less expensive pairs.I've been so happy with the purchase even though it was a luxury. I'm listening to music all the time and it's nice to have the toys that really make it sound good.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2023",AE75XV4PREKS5CTJPUBNHFT4BJXA,True,6,

Since time is of the essence, the clarity and precision of the sound rendering directly affects how much I can get done, as I can go faster the cleaner the sound it. It's a good improvement over my IE 100 Pro I was mostly using before. Anyway, for those that listen to music: Sound is very clean and uncolored so if you are looking for a thumping bass or something like that it's not for you. But again, precision is excellent. Very clean sound (which also brings out any issues from the DAC or the recording itself. - For example, an average MP3 is no match for a FLAC or even an AAC or Doly Digital).

R4R2Q9S4WBOGA,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars The most balanced headphones I've owned,Nora Howard,5,"These headphones are pretty much the standard for this price range, and excellent if you want to explore more detail in what you listen to.They are open-backed headphones, which means you can hear outside noise with them on more easily than normal closed-back headphones or earbuds with a rubber seal. (This is why I didn't rate it's noise cancelling, as that isn't something these try to achieve) It also means that they have a very wide soundstage. It's hard to describe if you're not into audio, but basically it feels less like the sound is coming from speakers right next to your ears and more like you're in a room with the music playing.The sound is remarkably balanced, meaning most frequencies are emitted by the speakers at about the same volume. Being open backed headphones, the subbase tapers off a bit at the end, but is still very easy to hear. These shine when listening to music of all sorts, but particularly big-band jazz and orchestra. That being said, when listening to hip hop or rock or something, I find myself picking out much more detail than with something like my Bose QC45s (which are great in their own way)So what's the catch? You will need to have something a little more powerful than a normal computer audio jack to drive these headphones. I use mine with a Moto M2 USB audio interface, which is great because you can also run monitors and two xlr mics with phantom power at the same time. These aren't cheap but are about best bang for your buck if you want to record as well. Otherwise, you can probably fine a USB headphone preamp to run these.Overall these are excellent headphones for just about anything.

RBU5HUBHZTW31,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic sound and unreal comfort,Chen,5,"I got my hd600 a week ago with that new grey color, and I like it a lot. It's very subtle, mature, and modern.I know the sound of this headphone has been extensively reviewed for the past 20 years, and people are probably bored of reading reviews, so I'll just briefly compare it to my Etymotic ER2SE IEM since both are tuned towards the diffuse field target.Both sound very natural to me. The sound signatures on these are more than 90% similar. ER2 is a little more realistic for some of the instruments I play. The hd600 is slightly bassy/darker, and the vocal is just slightly recessed. Yeah, you heard it right. It's recessed compared to the Etymotic. I prefer male vocal on the hd600 because it sounds fuller, and I prefer female vocal on the Ety because it sounds sweeter. The hd600 is a little veiled compared to ER2. Here is how I would describe it. If the brightest headphone is like the noon, and the darkest headphone is the midnight. Then ER2 is like the dawn, a little energetic, while hd600 is like the dusk, very relaxing. Although the lighting is similar, the feeling is different.HD600 has a larger soundstage and is inoffensive. There is a tendency to forget it is on my head after a while. The clamping force is not bad in this version. Transient seems to be better on ER2, but hd600 sound is smooth like silk. I seriously doubt I heard much detail difference. Sometimes I thought I heard some difference, then after switch, I found that's just the quality of my song... The hd600 is more detailed? But ER2 has at least 90% of details I heard on the hd600 at normal listening volume. However, ER2 is only one-third of that price (And don't forget that hd600 requires an amp such as JDS Atom.) Good job Etymotic. And you ask what about classical music? Nah I still prefer to enjoy it on my speakers because it's a totally different experience without sound appearing in or above my head. Nevertheless, I found there is indeed some magic happening when playing classical through hd600, like riding a water slide with gold powders falling down from the sky. I know it's a bad metaphor...The form factor is of course very different. When I switched to my ER2 while hd600 still playing, the sound leakage from hd600 and every other noise from the outside world is suddenly blocked. And when I put on my hd600 while ER2 playing. I can even hear the sound leakage from ER2 on my desk clearly.In summary, the new 2019 version of HD600 is definitely worth buying. It is very relaxing both comfort-wise and sound-wise.","Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2020",AG4ZTFAFFSFK4YDJE2BKZCC7S7VQ,True,1,

I already had some Sony 7506 and Audio Technica MTH-M50 for recording.Well I'm here to tell you, the HD-600 sounds the absolute best and flattest of ALL my head sets! Whatever adjustments or changes I make on the HD600 is exactly how it comes out on my studio monitors. It's almost a 1 to 1 translation. This is very important for mixing because you want to make sure that what you do in the studio translates to the real world (other people's listening systems).My other headphones all seem to have various sound profiles which doesn't exactly produce a good 1 to 1 translation. For the instance the 7506 is bright, the M50 is more dark & bassy, MP-1 has balance but is not very detailed or lacks depth compared to the HD600.Although I do like how the DT990 sounds, however, I tend to trust the HD600 more. the HD600 sound profile makes it particularly accurate and detailed if I'm mixing or doing sound editing. The 990 does have more bass however, so it can be useful for checking the lower levels of the bass regions in a mix.At the end of the day, if you do any mixing or editing, the HD600 is well worth the price.

Everyone's preferences are different, and Sennheiser truly has something for everyone--whether a bassy soundcurve for punch (for dance music, DJing, and fans of genres of music which rhythm is important to them), a neutral soundcurve for authenticity (for Classical music, movies, music as it is originally mastered, Musical Theatre, and TV series), or a trebly soundcurve for clarity (for audiobooks, news, sports, talkshows, and vocal music if understanding what is being said/sung is more important than reproducing how they sound in real life). The HD 600 is the well-built, open-back pair of headphones with that neutral soundcurve I've been looking for. If I have second thoughts, I will post an update.12/02/22 Update: While it doesn't bleed into the mids whatsoever, there may be a minor elevation in the bass register. I am going to give the HD 560S another try to determine if its treble causes silibance, and/or if its bass is too weak.12/05/22 Update: After researching headphones since February, I can understand why the HD 600 has maintained a high place among audiophiles and recording engineers since 1997. While its slight elevation in the upper bass register may help warm things up for a less fatiguing listening experience, such an effect might not be desired if your objective is something completely neutral/transparent. I never tried the HD 58X, HD 650, or HD 6XX, but they are reported to be even warmer than the HD 600.

Personally, I prefer some high end sparkle. These headphones did make me realize what soundstage is. And honestly, I also prefer the shp 9500's for being more intimate. These make the sounds come further from your head, but it isn't magical. It doesn't make things sound more 3d. Just.. honestly sounds more distant. Listening to my shp 9500's after these, does make me realize a few flaws with them. They do have some treble peaks that are a bit fatiguing after a while, but I've gotten used to their sound signature, I like my ears to hurt a bit while I listen to music. Also, the shp 9500's have that treble grain, but that's the only reason why I'm looking to upgrade from them. Also would be nice to have bass that doesn't roll off.

They produce an incredibly detailed and neutral sound that is intimate and clean, while also having robustness that inspires confidence in their build quality. While they can be driven by your phone or PC onboard audio, the sound quality definitely takes a hit from the lack of amplification, so it is highly recommended to use them with a proper DAC and Headphone Amp. I drive them with an Audient iD4 Audio Interface.These are open-back headphones, so they do not isolate sound well. It will be easy for users to hear surrounding noises, and also for others to hear what is playing through the headphones (though not overly loud). However, this also result in music that sounds more natural and clear. So while this means they do not make great travel headphones, they make fantastic studio / home headphones where it is quieter and people may not mind the sound leaking from the headphones.The clamp on these headphones are pretty strong. Those with big heads might need to stretch the headband a bit, or simply bear with the headaches. However, the earpads are quite comfortable. Once I get comfortable with the headphones, I can use them for hours and hours on end without feeling fatigued.However, these are not suitable for everyone as their bass is rather lacking (EQ fixes it a little bit) and its soundstage is not the greatest, but nothing is ever perfect.

I wanted to spend at least 100 hours listening to these headphones before really giving it a solid review. My original rating still stands as these sound absolutely amazing. I did not understand what that meant until I was able to compare them against several other headphones (Fostex T50RP MKIII Stock and modded) and my Audiotechnica ad700x. The main use would be strictly for gaming however I do listen to music on my PC as well.Sound QualityClear,neutral with slightly veiled sound. I remember reading these were very analytical but I like using the term surgical when it comes to being able to pick out details in the music and in game sound. Every little sound from chopping trees down to the pitter patter of distant footsteps are clearly delineated from all of the other in game sounds. Overall I enjoy the sound of the HD600. The mids and highs strike a perfect balance to my ears with the lows being non existent due to the open back nature of these headphones. You will want to use these in a quiet space since sound from your surroundings will bleed in to you listening experience. Make sure to pair these with a solid Amp/DAC combo . I currently use the Mayflower Arc and they power these cans with ease.ComfortThe clamping force of these cans are very nice and snug. I enjoy headphones that give a slight squeeze to my head and will not move if I tilt my head down. If you enjoy a fairly tight feel on your head than these are a great pair of cans. The ear pads are huge and can fit a fair amount of different sized ears with ease. They are a breathable velour material that actually stay nice and cool at least for me considering 6-8 hour gaming sessions. Overall the comfort in my opinion is amazing.Build QualitySeeing how it is made of plastic, one would think it would look and feel cheap however that is not the case with the HD600's. The material feels extremely durable and the build quality is high.OverallMy overall verdict after 100+ hours of use is definitely a must buy especially if you are starting to venture off into the world of good sound. These are likely better for those who enjoy listening to music at their desk and not for gaming but, I love these headphones for my gaming.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2018",AG76ISJCQ52FVZJGJ2A4I4DOSUSA,True,3,
RGD6JXF4VB4UP,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars Legendary sound and clarity,Cellar,5,"I'm a huge audio enthusiast so I'm always chasing the next thing in quality. I went from Audio technica m-50 to sennheiser hd 25-1 ii. Each purchase gave me a sense of enjoyment but also a sense of need to move a step up. For some reason every time I purchase headphones I'm blown away by the sound but also not completely satisfied. It wasn't until I purchased some really nice speakers that I understood that I like the fullness of speakers and the actual way our ears perceive sound.Now these things still don't reproduce the low ends that are capable on speakers that you can feel all over your body but these are legendary in detail retrieval. After owning everything under the sun I can say that these keep me satisfied with having just the next level of detail retrieval over other headphones. The m50 and sennheiser hd25 just seem to be missing something to my ears even when they sound amazing. The soundstage and imaging just cannot compete with speakers.With that said, I do feel that these do a better job that the other two that I own. I feel as if they are another level above my headphones. My speakers aren't so clear on detail retrieval. The imaging may not be as great as the speakers but the sense of detail retrieval makes me feel as if I can see the drummer in front of me tapping the hi hats into rhythm. Sure it may be a simulation as most music is digital now a days but the fact is these things shine where others dont. Speakers, or headphone you will be hard pressed to find something that can bring out this level of clarity in music.Im a very analytical person and I love to hear every little detail in my music. Sometimes these headphones do a little too much and make the music enjoyable because I am so distracted with all the different elements going on. Some people may or may not like this. If you purchase these you will know what I mean. Every recording you have ever heard on the radio a million times you should revisit just for fun. Youll be surprise how intricate the production was done. These things WILL bring out all the little details.Also don't use cheap source. You can really hear the level of quality in your audio files from mp3 to wav. If you love music and you want to hear it in a completely different way that you have heard before get these.I also want to note that these are very nuetral and detailed headphones. I do music production and I love this quality in my headphones. It may not be for everyone however if you don't enjoy having your music presented in such a manner.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2014",AEGFCKVYC3NBCXZ2RPVT7XGTDT5Q,True,3,
R4WBGVM01JGMS,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars Finally found a great set of cans!,ScottE,5,"I'm not a total audiophile, whatever makes someone an audiophile. I don't have a lot of money to throw at products, to figure out what sounds best to my ears. My first kind of pricey headphone purchase was a set of Grado 325s. I thought, and still think, they sound swell and I enjoy the soundstage but they sound so tinny with ear-piercing highs. And no, they are not comfortable at all, becoming fatiguing to both inner and outer ear at around an hour or so. After reading some super reviews I purchased the Audio Technica ATH-M50x (yes, the super-cool blue and copper colored ones). After some burn-in time I was thinking that these are on the complete opposite side of the spectrum, with lows coming in at around 45% of the sound coming through, mids at 20%, and highs at 35%. A little too bass-y for my taste, though overall more pleasing to my ears in all ways than my Grado 325s. What I found missing was the soundstage of the Grados as the M50x is a closed-back headphone. Indeed, the ATs actually seemed to sound best, oddly enough, with my iPhone 6S Plus driving it. Additionally, I have a crappy pair or Bose bluetooth headphones and in-ears, Shure SE215s, and RHA t20i's (the RHAs slightly besting the Shures) but I mention this solely so whomever reads this can see where I'm coming from listening-wise.So for my set up I have a 2015 MacBook Pro pushing sound through a HiFiMan EF2A tube amp/DAC, connected via USB. In addition I have a Dragonfly v.3 DAC, but I am not utilizing it at this time, as the Sennheiser require an amp, while the other headphones I listed (to my ears anyway) seem not to. The music I am listening to...The Beatles ""Abbey Road"" and Pink Floyd ""Wish You Were Here"" on CD, and also FLAC files of Bjork ""Biophilia"" and The Lumineers album of the same name. I have also listened to numerous recordings from my iTunes account at 256 kbps (go ahead and sneer, audiophiles...my HD album collection is just beginning), Lana Del Rey's ""Honeymoon"" and Metallica's black album, for example. The Senns handled everything I threw at them beautifully, without sounding muddy or exhaustingly high-pitched. I can tell some difference between the higher and lower-quality recordings, but the HD 600s make even the lower-quality recordings sound better than my other headsets. The Sennheisers strike the perfect balance of tonality for me, and have an amazing soundstage. I can't say how they sound compared to other headphones costing much more, but I personally feel I have finally found the headphones that I can be happy with (they're even comfortable!) and will not be searching any longer.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2016",AE7QBSV6TTY5UJ3EQUSUUZ3SQ7WQ,True,6,
RE3YDAZZ0LE9T,B00004SY4H,"5.0 out of 5 stars A+ Tier Quality & Tier B Value, These are it",Gary Woodsmith,5,"There have been so many reviews of these, I have little to add to their established legendary status & reputation.I have owned both the pre-2020 revision which were made in Ireland and had the speckled marble plastic mold. The new silent post-2020 revision, which are these, are just as excellent, though they are missing the fancy storage box.I was under the impression that this new silent revision was made in China, but to my pleasant surprise, I was apparently mistaken as the box says they are made in Ireland. Thank you Sennheiser for keeping your integrity even though things changed hands a little bit here.You will need an amp to get the full potential performance out of these headphones.Everyone is well aware of the pros and cons of these headphones and I can confirm both the pros and cons in my personal experience. As for the cons, there aren't any real complaints here. I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything, though I would like more low end sub-basd because it does roll off just a little bit to notice.If you are a bass-head, you need to look somewhere else. If you enjoy and appreciate full balanced rich neutral oriented sound, then these are it.Even though they may not have subwoofer level bass, it still produces deep and rich full range neutral leaning sound.I suggest looking at crinacle's website and youtube to see how they rank on his detailed and highly extensive tier list. He ranks these as Tier A while having a 2 star value rating. Both of those ratings together put these headphones with the top performers of any price range. They only way you're going to get anything significantly higher than these are if you start reaching the thousands of dollars just for the headphones.I suggest pairing these headphones with an Amp and DAC from Schiit audio. You can use whatever amp you want though, just make sure you use one because it needs it for higher volume and peak performance.Overall, these are currently my very top favorite headphone and have been my main choice since 2015 when I first experienced them first hand.If you are looking for a smoking deal for almost the same type of headphones, there is the massdrop HD 6XX for about $180-200. Those are Tier S in value and the same tier of performance as the HD 600's.The 6XX are supposed to be the balance between the HD 650/600.Others say the 6XX are the same as the 650, they are wrong, I repeat, they are the balance between the other two.The HD 600 will always have a place on my head.Highest of recommendations Tier A Performance and Tier B value.","Reviewed in the United States March 20, 2015",AFXUQRDIAZDHY7M5NXXQPKWISRXA,True,1,

Enache,5,"i have been an electronic music fanatic for many many years. techno, house, tech house, progressive house, deep house, etc. i have been producing music for about 3 years. i really wanted a very nice pair of headphones for checking my mixes on as well as for listening to music on without throwing off my ears. my studio monitors are the event opals. i am very picky about my sound. i did tons of research and found a bunch of open and closed back candidates in my price range (up to $500). these were the sennheiser hd600, sennheiser hd650, sennheiser hd25 ii, akg k701, grado sr325is, denon ahd2000, ultrasone pro750, beyerdynamic dt770 and dt7880. i was able to obtain all of them and spent about an hour with each one. without going into tons of detail, i found the hd600's to be by far the best headphones in the group, as well as the best headphones i have ever heard. the 650's are nice too but i found the bass to be mushy (they have more bass - directed to the average person that likes more bass, not the audio engineer). in 2nd place were the denon ahd2000, which sounded great, especially for closed headphones. up next were the hd25's, although i think they would be much better for dj'ing. their sound was much more aggressive and up front. i am completely in love with the hd600's and all i can say is that i HIGHLY recommend them. i finally found a pair of phones i really love! absolutely phenomenal.PS i would recommend upgrading the cable to the one that the 650's come with. thicker and better quality cable. it's here on amazon: [...]best of luck!EDIT: i also just want to add that getting a proper headphone amp for these is truly vital. they are 300 ohm headphones which is very high impedance so having a discrete amp to power them is of the utmost importance or you really are wasting your money. some cheap options are the Fiio E7 + E9 combo for just under $200. don't get just the E7.. you really cannot hear the difference. if you have a little more cash then the Nuforce Icon HD is $350. to put it in perspective, a pair of HD600's with one of these amps will sound far better than the $1500 HD800's with no amp (they are 600 ohms). it makes a huge difference! oh and it has been months since i initially wrote this review and i am still in love with these headphones. i have used them for working on my music while at home and listening to electronic music, classic rock, classical, and all kinds of videos, etc on the internet. they are incredible!

RP6LUQ3SC5RAN,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply the best,Brett,5,"I've had these for a long time now, realized I never wrote a review.Simply put, these are the best headphones I've ever used in my entire life.They're open-back, so not for use outside of home. But the listening environment they provide is superb. It's hard to describe, but it's a much more natural listening environment. A plus in my mind is that I can still hear what is going on around me. So if someone is calling me, I can still hear them (assuming the music isn't too loud).The sound quality is unmatched. Everything is clear as day, and you can hear every subtlety in your media.I say media because I use these both for gaming and music listening, as well as some sound recording.The accuracy is on a different level. The one thing that always amazes me is how spatial the sound can be. If you game, these headphones will have no issues telling you where sounds are coming from. Back, front, up, down. Assuming the games actually support that kind of sound.They are capable of being loud as hell, assuming you can drive them correctly. They can be used with a media player, but they are specifically designed to be driven with an amp. I use a desktop amp, and they can get incredibly loud with absolutely no distortion whatsoever.Bass response is not something you should be looking at these for. If you want your eardrums rattled, look for something else. These are true studio headphones, so they're mission is accuracy, not bass response.They're also super comfortable. I can wear these for extended periods of time with no real issues. The ear cups are large, so I'd expect anybody to be able to wear these. But they truly do wrap around your ears.Cable is also incredibly long. I'm able to get up and move around my desk with the headphones on the whole time. Plenty of cord length.Sturdy headphones too, I've wacked them plenty of times, dropped them plenty of times. The band is metal, so where I've dropped headphones and had one of the speakers snap at the joint, these boys eat it and question why you are such a clutz.They are just the best ever.

Obviously they wont work in a scenario where isolation is important, but if your looking at these headphones u probably know that already. They sound very neutral and well balanced with an incredible amount of detail and clarity and fantastic sound stage. switching from my studio monitors (Kali IN-5s) to my HD600's doesnt alter much at all unlike my ATH-M50s. The HD600 definitely has a somewhat speaker in the room experience compared to close back headphones. Probably because u have a little bleed from left to right and u can hear the room around you, but still a cool experience in comparison to close back designs. The HD600 are an industry standard for a reason. My only complaint or criticism is that i wish the chord was detachable, or at least thicker.

Cans.,insta,5,"The build of these is not excellent as they are mostly plastic but they do seem rather durable, Sound is just superb, rather flat with emphasis on mid clarity. The comfort is great besides for the rather tight clamp but that is easily remedied by stretching the plastic headband for a bit. Something about the tuning is just so satisfying, vocals especially shine with just amazing clarity, going from the hd660s to these was like lifting a thin veil from the sound, at the expense of sub bass to squeeze out that extra bit of mid clarity. Overall I’d say these are an amazing value at current price and offer great imaging, somewhat intimate soundstage, and just great details and clarity. although they are a bit anemic in the bass department they do have enough mid bass thump to satisfy my needs.Genres I listen to;-Metal (Nu Metal,Prog,Symphonic)- Old and Modern Rock- Classical/Symphonic- indiePersonal Ranking:Lcdx> hd600 > Sundara > dt1990 > hd660s","Reviewed in the United States September 11, 2023",AE46NWWUTSANSANNYKTA3JZW6F2A,True,13,
R1J6HNKGZJ7KON,B00004SY4H,"4.0 out of 5 stars It's annoying to switch back to the HD555s...so it must be good, right?",Geoff,4,"I have owned Sennheiser's HD555s since 2006. So after 5 years I decided I wanted a bit of an upgrade. By the way - as a sidenote - if you're buying your first pair of ""good"" headphones I would HIGHLY recommend the 555s (although I believe they've been recently replaced by the 558). It's a very good upgrade from cheap headphones and it certainly won't break the bank.As for the 600s: I made the plunge and spent what I consider to be an outrageous amount of money on sound (I also purchased the FiiO E9). Overall I spent around $500 on this. Was it worth it? I'm not sure - but I certainly love the sound I get out of this setup. It's interesting though: I didn't really appreciate the sound at first (even after burn in) and I was frustrated that I had spent so much money on the equipment. But when I tried using my HD555s again they sounded TERRIBLE. And that's saying something because the 555s were headphones that had treated me very well for five years. The analogy I'd make is similar to the switch from VHS to DVD. When I watched my first DVD 11 years ago I didn't really see what all the fuss was about. I didn't really see the difference...call me blind I guess. But after watching a bunch of DVDs, switching back to VHS to watch a movie made the difference much more apparent. THEN I started to appreciate the DVD quality.If you have money to spend and have already had HD555-tier headphones for a while then I'd say that you should get these. They sound a lot better than the 555s. However, make sure you have decent quality music or they will exaggerate the ""bad"" in the quality. I had to get new versions of a few songs because of this. Most of my music is 200-300kbps and it sounds fine. I don't claim to have super-hearing so I never bothered to get straight 320kbps MP3s or FLAC files. The 250kbps sounds just fine for me.You should be aware that these headphones leak WAY more sound than the 555s. It's a bit frustrating (I'm in a college environment) but it's okay. All my friends make fun of me for it (""WHY DO YOU HAVE HEADPHONES INSTEAD OF SPEAKERS IF THEY'RE BOTH LOUD?!?"" haha). It's alright though.Finally, make sure you get an amp. I like the E9 but have nothing to compare it to.Comfort: 8/10 (very comfortable but they're significantly tighter than the HD555 if you've ever tried that one)Sound quality: 10/10 (as reference, I'd say the 555s are a 6/10)Bang for buck: 7/10 (they're damn expensive, and there's no getting around that)","Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2011",AEU6TLT27QEYXNXDIAMP4OVTIC6Q,True,12,

However, I know the ear pads need some break in. After a few times I plugged in my bass, bass amp and a headphone amp. My gosh these sound good. The headphone amp really makes it with these. They have an excellent sound and definitely improved over time.I also have the DT 770 pro 80 ohm. I really like those, too. The main differences I see between the two are volume level and clarity. The hd600 has more volume without an amp. The dt770 pro 80 really needs an amp. I get popping when playing the bass with the dt770s and no amp. Clarity is much better with hd600, although the dt770 pro 80 has high bias. I like it but it isn't as clear as the hd600.I honestly don't think you can go wrong with either but I haven't played bass using the dt 770 pros since I bought the hd600s.Note: It took about two weeks for dt 770 pro 80 ohm to sound their best.

Which means it isn't bass heavy, so if you're looking for that keep looking. I heard the HE-400i/AKG is a good alternative to these and on par. (Again, just what I've read/heard)YOU WILL NEED AN AMP TO RUN THESE. Search the Objective2+ODAC combo by JDS Labs. Or you can use the Fiio/ Schiit Stack/whatever, (I don't know) to run them. It's up to you to research a bit and find out. I bought the O2+ODAC because it was recommended, it's small as can be (Like literally 3x4x4 inches, like an index card worth an entire paycheck), and you can get an engraving! Warning: It's expensive.Pro's:+Really light weight and comfy to wear. I wore these for like two hours straight and almost forgot I was wearing them. Seriously, my brain was like ""Bruh, this is some good music, but where's it coming from?"" and I legitimately looked around before realizing I was an idiot.+Long cord, first for me and I'm used to being tethered by a 1-2ft radius to my PC. Laid down on my bed while not thinking and then panicked thinking that I had dragged the PC/Why hasn't my head been yanked back yet? Was wonderful not having to fear that anymore.+Came extremely well packaged. Comes in a custom box lined with black Styrofoam on both sides outlining the shape of the headphones.+Sounds really clear and loud (depending on your amp).+Great everything, listened to a dubstep song and was actually surprised by how 'punchy' the bass was. Decent. Listened to some orchestra and piano, and I could...It's hard to describe, I could hear the ""distance"" of each instrument and individually pick out what each person was playing if I focused on them. For gaming: Whoa, I can hear their footsteps and if they're behind the wall or above me. It's weird adding that immersion and many times someone's called BS on me for seeming to ""Wallhack"" even though I could hear them getting ready to run around the corner.Info: Comes with a 1/4 inch plug that can be taken off. It literally slides off and viola, there's the 3.5mm plug underneath it.Con's:-Expensive.

Yes , I am one of the HD800S owner who wanted beside my HD800S the HD600 and the HD650 also. HD650 has that Sennheiser Vail what people mentioned.

The HD800S brings it out and I can't handle it and I have to take the headphone off. Very unforgiving headphone that for sure. That why I listen well recorded classical music and Soundtracks only. I never heard the HD800 , the silver original one. I can imagine with the 6.3Khz treble spike can make those recordings even more harsh.

These headphones fit even without bending the metal as some might advise(which I highly recommend NOT doing). They're extremely comfortable and definitely worth buying even just for comfort reasons.The sound is out of this world. I doubt you'd be able to find headphones in the same price range that will have singers sounding as if they're using your face as the microphone. It's an unreal experience and all people deserve to experience it. The bass is clear and solid too.People complain about a veil and soundstage, but tbh it's something no one would notice unless they are comparing headphones and it's their job to clarify the differences. I play video games, and I have a pair of AKG K712Pros. AKG is notorious for its soundstage being massive. When playing Valorant and any other game where I care about enemy positioning I find the HD600 will always give better direction. Not that the AKG isn't clearly larger sounding, but because the HD600 headphones sound is inside your head. The sounds feel closer and you can pick out directions much easier than if they were much farther away. But even then I still feel a much closer realism to sound even when listening to songs meant to sound larger such as orchestras because the clarity is so much better. I would always pick the HD600 over my K712Pro no matter the sensation I'm looking for.TL;DR - Fit's a 63cm head comfortably and audio clarity sounds like you're getting a live performance in your room.","Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2022",AFYYVR7UQDGHN3RTA6BLTSSLMF7Q,True,1,

REWC67MZICRVM,B00004SY4H,"5.0 out of 5 stars Beautifully balanced and tuned with a clean, open sound signature.",Taylor Green,5,"Now that it is nearly standard to find these headphones at a sub-350 dollar price point it's important to note the excellent value and nearly unbeatable performance within this price range.I'm a skeptic about burn-in, as it's been scientifically proven that the measurements really don't change much at all over time, it's more about how you've adjusted to the tuning of the headphones over time. Regardless, these sound clean, crisp and beautiful right out of the box. Very slightly on the warm side with practically perfect mids that don't shout and stay remarkably clean, the highs are smooth but certainly not rolled off, the extension and detail are both excellent and are a very welcome aspect of the tuning if you're not a fan of ""bright"" or overly accentuated treble in headphones.So...this brings us to the bass, and the bass is an important topic when it comes to the HD600 because it has become polarizing and has even been considered a weakness of the headphone. For starters, the sub bass is a bit on the weak side, by no means empty or thin, but it definitely does take a back seat to the mid bass, which is extremely well extended and detailed. From this aspect of the sound we can assume that sennheiser has really attempted a more neutral approach to the bass response.The result is bass that is tight and very accurate without being boomy or overbearing, however it is present and accounted for. I would recommend trying them if at all possible before purchasing to find out if it's suits your listening preferences.As far as comfort is concerned they're absolutely a headphone you could wear all day without any problems, lots of space within the ear cups themselves and very comfortable and thick velour padding on both the headband and the ear pads.In short, for a now 300-350 dollar headphone it would be nearly impossible to find a better buy or value than the HD600, especially considering the build quality and removable cables which can ensure years of listening and use as your daily driver. However, if you plan on using these as your PC/Desktop headphones, I would without a doubt recommend a dedicated amp/DAC combo. I use an objective2 + ODAC combo to drive these cans, which are 300 ohms, but the result is an absolutely stunning and clean performance throughout any video or song.","Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2015",AG2R73R2L7BKU3CGNKAFJU5WSQEA,True,2,

This is the type of sound that I like, clean, neutral, incisive, and with perfect tuning. The HD600 is known as a classic for a reason. I was worried about the bass due to a series of review around internet but let me tell you I have no issue at all with this bass--the quality is great and it's not this kind of annoying thumpy, boomy bass that I get from my Bose noise-cancelling headphone. The quantity is sufficient for my use case and do not tire my ears out. Beautiful sound--absolutely a keeper.Note: You will need a really good amp to truly drive this 300 ohm beast to its true potential. My review is based on a pairing with the then $600 Ifi iDSD Black Label (now discontinued) which I have owned since 2017.

R1BLD2EP1OFZJM,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars WOW - A great pair of headphones!,Justin W. Smith,5,"From the moment I put these on I was in love with the sound! I am a budding audiophile so I will admit that I have not had a chance to audition these next to the HD 650s, Grados or any of the other super-high-end cans that people often compare these to – so I cannot offer any guidance as far as how these may be better or worse than any of those.What I can say is that compared to my Bose AE2 headphones, my Shure earbuds or the stock Apple headphones the soundstage on these is amazing. The first thing I noticed when I put these on is that music had a warmer sound and I felt more like I was sitting in a room filled with music rather than just like my head was filled with music). I have a feeling that the open back design really makes a difference because it does not reflect the sound waves coming off the back of the cones off the back and into the ear. It does not have the punchy bass of the Bose headphones - so I will admit that music that is meant to be bass heavy will not get the boost from these that classic rock and piano and guitar jazz do. I have found these headphones to be very comfortable. They have a heft that suggests they are well made and durable but they still feel like on your head and the pressure and padding are just right. Also, and maybe this is also due to the open back design, my ears don't feel as warm after several hours of continuous wear.As for my equipment I am hooking these up to a 2012 iMac using B&W MM-1's as my DAC/Amp and playing music from iTunes. The source material is a mix of Apple Lossless and high nitrate AAC and MP3 files. -- I should point out these are 300Ohm cans so they do take more power to run. I have to turn the volume up a lot more on the MM-1s and in iTunes than I would ever do to wear the Bose AE2's comfortably!I will test them out on my Yamaha receiver shortly thanks to the included 1/8->1/4 adapter that is included.","Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2013",AGDZPPJMZ6G4YWSIMTME44ZKYAXA,True,2,

Recently I went on the quest for the perfect headphone to plug into my computer while I’m working at home, or web surfing.I first purchased a pair of Sennheiser HD 598 Cs on a black Friday sale, as an impulse purchase. I still own them and think they are an amazing value for a closed headphone design, but once I understood the advantages of an open back design I started looking for another pair. I tried Beyerdynamic DT-990 and the Philips X2’s. Both are very nice headphones. The Beyerdynamic’s were very “Hot” = terrible heavy. The Phillips had good bass, but like the DT-990’s they lacked the mid-range clarity, which I felt was still better on my 598’s.The Sennheiser HD600’s have been everything I hoped for from a sound quality standpoint. They have a beautiful open sound stage with wonderful balance and clarity throughout the tonal range. The mid-range reproduction really allows me to savor my favorite vocal performances. The bass is I believe as it should be, but may not be to some tastes that are used to devices that deliver lots of artificial bass boasting.How the headphones look wasn’t important to me and that’s good because the blue plastic material they are made of seems to be a design left over from the 1990’s when these were first produced. They are fairly comfortable, but they do need to be stretched out, as out of the box they clamp your head a little too much.The HD600’s have 300 Ohm impedance, which means they might not play very load with your mobile device; although they play at a very comfortable max volume on my iPhone 6 on most tracks. I wouldn’t want to play them much loader and because of the sound leakage with the open back design I would never take them out of the house anyway. On my home computer I use a Behringer HA400 Micro-Amp, which works great with the HD600’s and I can leave my HD598’s plugged in, as well as two other pairs of headphones. ….. But, since I got the HD600’s I haven’t been doing much switching back and forth. :-)","Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2017",AG3O3DSTLKBBAJOEM3YOICLJ6G5Q,True,5,

I'm an independent music producer and mix engineer so my perspective is not audiophile or consumer, rather it is ""representation of what I think the music should sound like."" If that sounds biased, it is, biased by a lot of listening, making commercial/pop music, and teching gear for 20+ years.Signal path for both: Spotify premium >cheap PC soundcard >o2 headphone ampvs Beyer DT880 600ohm , these have :- less 40Hz- way more 60-200Hz- more or less similar freq resp (different imaging) in the mids- way less 4k-15kThe Senn600's sound just like the 650's I bought 2-3 years ago, and later sold (warm & ""smooth"" & enjoyable, but not enough detail for mixing). People who are splitting hairs between these 2 models have nothing better to do.Soundstage i.e. the ambient experience here is close and tight, like most traditional headphones, overly sensitive to panned instruments. ENTIRELY different vs the overly open soundstage and clarity of reverbs etc of the 880s. When guitars are panned hard L/R in the Senn's, that's what you hear: 2 clear sources, panned hard. Perhaps not as musically enjoyable as a more active soundstage, but it is ""accurate"" to the mix. Remember, the track was probably mixed on speakers in a room, not on headphones thus SHOULD sound overly defined in ""accurate"" headphones. +1 for Senn soundstage simplicity & accuracy, -1 for boringThe Beyers create an airy, immersive, bubblebath soundstage around you. From low mids to high mids it is as luxurious as the felt pads on your ears and reveals tons of detail (too much, wait for it). They also hit you in the sub quite easily. However it would be DIFFICULT to hear and transcribe a bass line using these, as there is little representation of the most pitched notes of a bass guitar (~60Hz -250hz) +1 for Beyer mindless musical enjoyment, -1 for unrealistic imagingBeyers high end is annoying: you can quite easily hear whether something was recorded to tape or to some digital method. Many Top40 hits that I thought everywhere else in life sounded pretty good showed their true colors with obvious grainy shrill constant high-end noise, revealing a nasty harshness that you're not going to ever hear in your car or maybe even your earbuds. -1 for Beyers going too far in the high end dep'tBut overall the lack of ""bass guitar"" range bass, and overstated top top end i.e. 8k-20k, had me running from the 880's. Note that I burned them in for 4-5 days of various pop music on repeat. This didn't really change their rather shrill character which was unlistenable by my tastes on modern digitally-recorded or cheaply recorded pop music. +1 for Beyers revealing the air band, -1 for it not really mattering unless you're recording Norah Jones/classicalSenn for obviously muddy 100-200Hz -1and as many would say ""smooth"" top end (i.e. lack of detail & LPF rolloff) -1So:Senn600=muddy with traditional headphone imaging. Will keep you from mixing overly muddy, but you might exaggerate top end & reverbs in the mixBeyer880=bass is pretty much a large one-note sub, but clarity in mids & highs that feels luxurious, as long as you're not sensitive to freq's above 10k, at which point any harshness like digital distortion will become distracting and possibly hurtful.Hope this adds clarity to whether either of these are for mix engineers or not.

I have been an audiophile all my life and recently have been able to purchase higher end equipment for listening to music, editing videos, recording voice overs for videos. Simple and concise, if you're on somewhat of a budget for a high end listening experience, look no further and buy these.Sound: The quality is phenomenal. Vocals are clear and crisp, guitar strings really sound authentic, and the bass isn't overwhelming which I found pleasurable despite me always looking for strong bass in headphones. It really lets you appreciate the producers work, I am hearing things in the album ""Views"" by Drake that I have never heard before.

I recommend a good sound card as well, I think this is a huge benefactor in unleashing the potential of these headphones.

Extremely comfortable to wear, even over long periods of time, and fairly lightweight. Good dynamic sound and excellent base response.Just to be clear, these headphones absolutely *do not* provide noise cancellation. They are open-ear as part of their design for dynamic range. I'm not sure why Amazon even included a rating scale for that on these headphones (it's like asking for a pressure rating on a screen door) but this has been rated as appropriate.Now bear in mind, there are some factors to your listening enjoyment:- The media being played. Bitrate and compression are your metrics here. If you're listening to something low bitrate or compressed to hell and back, it doesn't matter what headphones you're using. The source recording also matters; bands may re-record for new releases and differences in equipment can affect quality.- Your source and amplification. If you have a source that can function without an amplifier of some kind then you can use these standalone. You may want to consider dropping a little extra on headphone amplifiers (e.g. an inline or a receiver) so you can reduce the source volume and rely on the amp for volume control. Not doing this can result in hiss or other audio issues.- Your cabling and how it's routed. At it's core, every cable is an antenna. Your will be picking up EMI from anything carrying electricity, be that your in-home electrics to the equipment you're connecting to. Most audio cables on the market will be shielded (barring some that forego this, opting to instead coat the cable in resin or braided fibers) cable quality varies. If you're having audio issues, don't discount the cables being used.Overall this is exactly what I had been looking for with a decent set of reference headphones.

With a decent headphone amplifier, the HD600 is preferred by many over other headphones in higher price categories. These headphones were designed to have a flat sound signature and plays best with classical- and jazz-type music.Comfort: 9/10 (after adjusting clamping force)[http://www.head-fi.org/t/438898/hd650-hd600-hd580-comfortable-uncomfortable-or-fractured] Velour pads are ridiculously soft and breathable, with the headband pads having the same story. The open design of the cup allows for good airflow which, combined with the pads, prevent discomfort caused by heat. The clamping force at first may be a bit overwhelming, but over time it goes down, and can also be adjusted using a flexing technique.Build Quality: 7/10 with stock cable, 9/10 with HD650 cable or other upgrade. You may be intimidated with the high amount of plastic used, but the plastic is very strong and can withstand a lot of punishment. The stock cable that comes with the HD600 is a bit thin, and over time the left channel gave out. I recommend getting the stock HD650 cable, as it is much thicker and resistant to wear. Taking apart the headphone for cleaning and maintenance is a breeze. You are able to get to and take out the driver within a matter of seconds. The pads come off with just a little pull effort, and snap right back into place.Sound: 8/10 As usual with Sennheiser, the mids are absolutely perfect. The highs are very clean and balanced with little distortion. However they eventually do roll off a bit, which leads to a lack of spaciousness that could be found in the higher-end lineup. Bass is there, only just a bare minimum, but it is tight and ""proper"". The biggest problem with the sound is that the sub has significant roll-off, which can be a turn-off for most electrical or hip-hop tracks. If that issue were fixed, it would make no sense looking any further for headphones at this price range. Again, I am not saying the sub is not there, it is just not too impressive.","Reviewed in the United States May 18, 2015",AHQNP7X4TXLNEUC2RXWALQMV6M2A,True,10,

In the studio I have a very nice pair of Meyer HD-1 monitors along with four other sets of speakers for checking how my mix translates to other speakers.I have four sets of headphones that I check mixes with. ATM-50 is a favorite of mine when I'm tracking but when mixing the HD600 offer a more accurate view of the sonics. The HD600 are quite bright sounding which helps reveal shortcomings in recordings.I also have the HD650 which I find more pleasant for listening to music, they have lots of high frequency response but it's not as ""pushed"" as the HD600 seem to be.The HD600 are listed as 300 ohm headphones but I've not encountered any situation where they are not loud enough. My Soundcraft mixing console specs recommend headphones 200ohms and higher, the HD600 play very loud when connected to the console headphone amp output.I like these headphones a lot, the open air construction sounds smooth and open, much more so than with the ATM-50 which have a deeper and more punchy ""rock"" sort of sound. I like both of these models and they both have their place.Watch the price, when I bought my HD650 for around $312 the HD600 was priced at $379. A couple of weeks later the HD600 were down around $275, so their price fluctuates at times. $300 is about as much as I'd ever spend on a set of headphones regardless of how good their specifications.If I could only buy one set I think it would be the HD600 because I like the transparency in the high frequencies for recording applications.If I was just listening to CD's and music for fun I'd buy the HD650 because they're easier on your ears for long periods of listening.

If this was my first set of Sennheiser I would said “wow, I love it ! ” however I had been using the HD 660s for a few years now and when comparing both headphones , the HD 600 sounded more narrow and dark but not always a bad thing , I also found the HD 600 is a little bit harder to drive and not always able to get the sound I wanted . If I have to pick , I would choose the HD 660s over the HD 600 since it’s more well rounded. A little dispointed how the HD 600 came , Sennheiser no longer ship them with a storage case , just a thin paper box..Still the HD 600 is still a good headphone","Reviewed in the United States December 14, 2022",AFYEALZFQYTSUIF7TGV2CSZ27FNA,True,3,
R1B5RAUXGKYT10,B00004SY4H,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent headphones. Amazing sound quality.,The Steve,5,"These are by far the best headphones I've ever used, as well as the most expensive. I've been fairly dedicated to Sennheiser over the years (don't fix what isn't broken), and I'm yet to be disappointed. These cans have incredible depth and sound stage. I'm driving them off of a Schiit Asgard 2 connected to their Bifrost. High-quality audio and video is amazing, while even lower-end sounds are vastly improved. There isn't an incredible amount of low-end power behind these. I definitely wouldn't call it lacking by any means, but these aren't going to shake your skull when an explosion goes off. These are still very, very accurate headphones that clarify every sound coming through them. I use these primarily for gaming with other audio and HD video entertainment from time to time. In-game positioning is incredibly accurate, and you can make out every single sound from gunshots to footsteps to windows breaking across an entire map (such as T-spawn to sniper nest on Mirage in CSGO).I'm rather tall (6'4"", 205lbs) and have a decently large head. The fit was a bit snug at first compared to my HD598s and PC360s. It took a bit longer to break in physically compared to those, but these are still very light and don't bother me for extended gaming sessions in the slightest. After a week of moderate usage I don't even notice them on my head. The padding on the headband and around the ears is soft yet firm.I can't necessarily compare these to other headphones in the same price range, as these are the most expensive cans I've purchased to date, but I can say they're a definite improvement over my HD598s. Maybe not twice the product for >twice the price you're paying, but things get exponentially more expensive as you start climbing the circumaural headphone ladder. I would absolutely recommend these for the price. Just be sure you have a very solid DAC and AMP powering these. They require a lot to properly drive, but they are definitely worth it.","Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2016",AFIO3EJFCK6VZF3D2BJS2IOLDUIQ,True,1,

R3VAI5P62QVY1D,B07DHHXZRN,3.0 out of 5 stars Beats Studio 3 wireless came Sept. 4th of 2017. Bad reviews before this date are fake.,David Banner,3,"***Update December 29th 2017***.I am reducing my rating the three stars not because there's anything wrong with these headphones, but because I listen to the Sony WH-100XM2 headphones and quite honestly those are breathtaking. And for the money I am wanted to be blown away by a pair of headphones that cost this much. After listening to my wife's cheap $30 Sony headphones from Walmart I realize that these beats that I bought sounded just about as good which was disappointing. So it's really all about reference. The Sony's that I just mentioned above alright night and day difference and quite frankly the wow factor I was looking for. Absolutely everything that the Beats can do till Sony's can do probably 10 times better. Sound quality is so good I can't really describe it. Noise cancelling is definitely even better and all the different options that you can do with the Sony makes it worth the cost. So I returned the Beat Studio 3. I felt people should know that if they're going to spend this much on headphones you should definitely listen to the Sony's.I ordered my Beats Studio 3 wireless headphones a week ago. First thing to know...anyone writing about how bad they are durability wise and dated before September 4th of 2017 are fake or an older model is being mistakenly referred to. September 4th of 2017 are when these studio series 3 came out. People talking about how they can't hold up for over a year couldn't have possibly owned a pair for that long. Keep that in mind. But I will say at this point is, I listened to these with a variety of music so far and they sound incredible. Seems like the way these are tuned, you have to turn them up a little bit (volume to ""medium"") to get the best sound. When they're very quiet it just doesn't seem like the Fidelity is quite as good as when they're turned up a little bit more. Of course that last statement is very subjective. I listened to Bose at a Target about a day before and those sounded very good as well. I can't truly tell which one sounds better unless I had them both in front of me and both playing the exact same song from the same source and switch back and forth to really hear it. But I will say from my reference, these sound pretty much the same in terms of sound quality. As far as noise cancelling goes, anything that has a constant sound in the background such as fans, refrigerators running or someone mowing the grass outside etc. pretty much anything that's a constant sound, as soon as you turn on the noise cancelling, those sounds are completely killed. Cannot hear them at all. You can continue to hear people talking and you can hear sounds happening on the TV if it's loud enough but all of that (random sounds) are greatly muffled. Keep in mind that noise cancelling does not work well on sounds that are random. That goes for any brand. There is no doubt however that the noise cancelling is working and working well.I can't say again whether or not bose is better. When I tried them out in the store at Target, the bose sounded about the same... all background sounds completely killed and I was able to hear people talking to me although they sounded distant/much quieter and with a greatly reduced bass in their voice (bose/beats about the same).Also I'm not an apple Fanboy type either. I do not own an iPhone, I have a Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. Pairing these with my Samsung was pretty straightforward, hold the button for 5 seconds make sure your Bluetooth is on and phone picked them up. Next time you turn on the Beats, make sure you have your Bluetooth turned on first and they automatically connect.One last thing, when it comes to comfort, anyone saying that these things hurt their head hurt their ears or grip too tight, must have their head made out of paper mache or tissue paper. These are some incredibly comfortable headphones and I could wear them indefinitely without any problem whatsoever.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2017",AG4WAQZQSA4IL77NREIMNVCBC2PQ,True,74,Color: Blue

R2B4DP8VQYZS78,B07DHHXZRN,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Commuter Headpone,Bay Area Denizen,5,"I've owned multiple high quality ear buds and headphones. I've never been convinced ANC headphones were needed. Just turn up the volume. I ride BART everyday and over the last few years the train system has become more crowded and the rails even more ""screechy"". The average decibel level throughout the BART system has been documented at 100. Supposedly the same as a jackhammer. One cannot hold a conversation without shouting, or at least raising your voice and talking into the ear of the person you are trying to communicate with. The Beats Studio 3 passed this test with flying colors. I borrowed my sons Bose QC III's last week and they were excellent. I was able to listen to classical music in virtual peace I came close to buying the QC's. I changed up when I viewed multiple You Tube comparisons. I wanted the W1 chip and the pure compatibility with my IOs ""eco-system"".l (Ok I drank the Apple kool-aid, but the stuff just works!) Cutting to the chase: the Beats ANC is just as good as the Bose QC's, the Studio 3 is an excellent evolution in sound quality. I found the dynamic range to be more than acceptable. I listen to a variety of music, EDM, hip hop, folk, classical, jazz, r&b, blues....you get the picture. The controls are intuitive and easy to access. The dedicated IOs pairing is seamless and fast. The b/t range is amazing. The ANC shuts out almost everything. This morning, two teens were non-stop talking and shouting to each other during the entire ride into the city. I did not hear a thing. The ambient noise sensors seem to work. The ANC sensors does allow for just a tiny bit of the train operator's PA voice to come through, a good feature if the train operator begins screaming ""Fire!! Abandon ship!"". The most amazing thing, is the Beats ANC like the QC's stifled the 100 decibel scream of the BART tracks. Can't say enough about these cans. The charge should last a week assuming 1 hr each way for 5 days. They are perfect for the daily train or plane commuter who desires freedom from NOISE! The cost has also been reduced to a price point which makes more sense. Hope Bose reduces the $$ on the mildly overpriced QC IIIs. Btw, good to check the headphones for authenticity, just in case the vendor on Amazon pulls a fast one.","Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2018",AHSU7L2RVY7G3RQCC3BDXX5GKLRQ,True,21,Color: Matte Black
R1PJKZQXOIV3ZX,B07DHHXZRN,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great, authentic headphones",Public Name,5,"I’m overwhelmingly happy with these headphones. While I was hesitant to spend so much on headphones to begin with, I do think it was money well spent. I’m not anything close to a music quality expert, but the sound quality for me has been excellent, not only for music, but also for podcasts. I’m not noticing any kind of lag when using the headphones to watch videos online, and I also haven’t had any connectivity problems. The bluetooth connection is strong, even with several doors are closed between the headphones and my phone. Overall the thing I’ve been most happy with is the ability to switch between all of my apple devices without having to constantly disconnect and reconnect my headphones; the W1 chip was a major reason why I decided on these vs. Bose headphones, and it paid off. I’d say it takes maybe 1-2 seconds to switch between my phone and laptop, and the headphones do automatically connect to the last known device if they’re powered off and then powered on again.Noise cancellation has been fine, although it’s not something that’s a dealbreaker for me. I do like that you can switch noice cancellation on/off either manually on the headphones or under the bluetooth settings on my phone/laptop. Battery life has also been fine; the 22 hour prediction with noise canceling on vs. 40 hours with it off seems to be accurate, however if you’re listening to very loud music that can drain the battery faster than predicted (this is true of most headphones though). The fast charging feature works, and the overall time to completely charge the headphones is roughly 1 hour. I haven’t had any problems with using them for calls as everyone I’ve talked to on the phone can’t tell I’m using headphones, which is great. I would definitely buy these again, and I’m happy with my purchase.** If you’re interested in checking whether your Beats are authentic (I was), download the firmware updater that’s availible at the Beats website. If your beats don’t appear when running the updater, you’ve likely got a pair of fake beats. Authentic Beats Studio3’s also has a serial number inside the slider of the right earcup; if your beats don’t have this, they’re almost guaranteed to be fake. Mine did turn out to be authentic, although I was quite sure they would be as I purchased directly from Beats through Amazon and not another seller. **","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2018",AGDBIANVC6BO33PLUG6HUJVTJY3A,True,25,Color: Matte Black

R1BGDQVEY7CME9,B07DHHXZRN,3.0 out of 5 stars Great except for one annoying thing that happened to me,Deeds777,3,"About a month ago, I would have given these a 5 star review. The sound quality is great, the Bluetooth is amazing (especially with Apple devices) and the battery life is phenomenal, but I did have a problem with them. Paying more than $300 for headphones is no easy task for me but due to a great Black Friday deal, I decided to treat myself. After four months of use I started to notice some pretty significant cracks on the inside of the head band. Keep in mind, I gave quite a bit of care to these and always kept them in the hard shell case when not in use. I never dropped, misused, or did anything to explain the cracks. Also, the cracks were on the inside of the headphones and even something like a drop would not have caused them. However, I also know that even the best companies sometimes produce defective exceptions. This is why we have warranties.I took the Beats to my Apple Store and showed them the product. The store rep sent them off to be repaired as a warranty repair as it was clear the damage was not due to an accident. A few days later, I get an e-mail from Apple asking me to authorize the repair and they wanted $199 for it. I called Apple support and after having to get a senior rep to open the notes, I was told that the damage was determined to be ""accidental"" and not covered by the warranty. I asked how that was possible since no accident could have caused them. Of course, the poor call center rep wouldn't know but she told me to go to my Apple Store and they could override their decision. I then go back to the store where the nice tech looks them over and tells me that the support team didn't really do a great job explaining things and though he saw what I meant about it being a defect, but there was nothing he could do and they would just overrule them again when they sent it off and they would tell me to pay the bill. He also mentioned that he didn't understand why Apple decided to switch to plastic over metal when it came to beats.I'm an Apple loyalist. However, my two star deduction is more due to them. #1 for opting for a cheap plastic and still charging $350 for headphones and #2 not standing by their decision to use flimsy plastic and trying to right their defective product. For $200, I can buy a pair of Sony's or Bose and I don't trust the Beats to not break again. After all that, I bought a $6.00 plastic bonder to seal the cracks because I'm not going to pay that much for a repair that may lead to the same problem down the line anyway as it will be the same plastic.I should also note that my head is a little wider than most and you may not have this same issue as me. However, if you are in need of a more durable headphone, I'd look more at Bose or Sony because Apple is not going to help you if something goes wrong with the material.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2019",AEAB24IVGYKLK557PAUALQQLFPDQ,True,9,Color: Blue

While these do not produce a ""flat"" sound like most studio monitors (like Sony MDR-7506, they sound spectacular. I listen to music on headphones about 4-6 hours a day and these have completely blown me away. I no longer use my skullcandy earbuds, my Sony, Vmodas, or Audio Technicas (see below). I love these headphones.Pros- incredible sound. The bass is punchy, filled with depth. Mids and highs sound great as well. While they don't have a truely ""flat response"", they sound excellent. If you listen to Rap, EDM, Metal, Punk, Jazz, Rock they sound insane.- Extremely comfortable. The ear pads are plush and conform around your ear. I can wear them for hours with zero fatigue.- Battery life: Insane, lasts me for 3 days (avg listening 6-8 hours) before needing to recharge. They recharge to 100% very quickly (within about 2 hours), they also have a quick charge feature where they can get several hours of playback on a few hours charge)- Bluetooth range: this is the crazy part, I can leave these on one end of my gym and walk about 130 feet away and get full signal even through two. walls.- Durability: Headband is metal with solid hinges. They feel sturdy.- Looks: they look badass. I got them in matte black and love them.CONS:- Price: they can be rather expensive to some, but honestly for the quality you get I actually think they worth it.I have some Sony MDR-7506(s), Audo Technica ATH-M50x, and V-Moda M-100's and these sound MUCH, MUCH better.

R1G66BLC8YXTA0,B07DHHXZRN,5.0 out of 5 stars The Beats Studio 3 are a welcome upgrade to the series,Matthew Schmitz,5,"I wanted to start off this brief review by stating that I wear headphones almost my entire day at work. I have owned several Beats headphones in the past and currently own also the Beats Solo 3, Solo 2, Beats X, and PowerBeats 3 models. When I heard that the Studio Wireless headphones will be including the W1 chip in the new Studio 3 models, I wanted to buy it right away. I use the Solo 3 headphones each night and keep them on my nightstand, but my one complaint is that as a person who wears eyeglasses, the on ear design hurts my ears when wearing glasses after an hour or so and I have to take them off. I've now had the Studio 3 Wireless headphones for a couple weeks now and I can say that I can wear them an ENTIRE workday (8 hours) with my glasses on and experience no discomfort. The sound is excellent and having the W1 is just amazing. The battery life with ANC on and the range included with the technology make these head and shoulders better than previous models.While you can turn ANC off and get 40 hours of battery life, I leave it on because while working the noise cancellation is worth it and 22 hours of battery life is not bad at all. The headphones come with the traditional Beats audio cable with remote and a micro USB charging cable. They are super easy to pair on iOS devices and are just a joy to use. The sound is excellent and not too over EQ'ed. I listen to podcasts more than music, but I do occasionally listen to music on them and I cannot complain about the sound.","Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2018",AHKFWUOINDOUUY5ABKHPGFSH55LA,True,313,Color: Matte Black

The noise cancelling feature works so well ...,Gladys,4,"I decided to invest in a decent pair of noise cancelling headphones to protect my hearing from the onslaught of eardrum busting noise that occurs during my daily commute. Between harsh noises of riding the subway and jackhammer poundings when passing construction sites, I couldn't hear anything on my old pair of headphones without turning the volume way up. I figured I must be doing some serious damage to hearing. Just got these and so far they are pretty great. The noise cancelling feature works so well when I am on the crazy loud subway. I can finally tone down the sound of screeching train wheels and still listen to podcasts are music. The overall sound quality, whether or not the noise cancelling features is on or off is very good too. I am no audiophile so I can't make claims about superior sound when I listening to music on them, but everything I have listened to on these sounds a lot crisper and cleaner than with my previous $40 pair of wireless headphones.They are pretty comfortable, too. They are certainly heavier than my cheaper pair. I am hoping that overtime I will get used to the difference in weight. I like that they fold up. The carrying case is way to big for my shoulder bag, but I am sure it will come in handy when I pack them in a suitcase for a trip.Cons: You have to use your phone to switch the noise cancelling feature off and on.

That, and the sound was empty and flat compared with either Sony or Bose. What was most surprising to me was they didn't have strong bass, which I had thought they were known for.I put on the Sony and they were bigger but somewhat better fitting, not a lot lighter, but with more of a clear and full range from high to low.I put on the Bose and it was surprisingly and significantly lighter and better fitting than either of the others and the sound was basically perfect. Good bass, full range of highs and lows. I have to admit that I had to switch back and forth between the Sony and the Bose about 10 times to determine if I *really* preferred the Bose to the Sony, and they were actually pretty darn close.

R1JSYSRULAWR2Y,B07DHHXZRN,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good, but deeply flawed headphone.",Izzy,3,"I really wanted to like it. But then again, I’ve wanted to like Beats headphones since the first ones were introduced, and I’ve found that even now, nearly a decade into their existence, they still suffer from a lot of the same flaws as they did on day 1.- Weak, confidence uninspiring plastic. These will not survive regular travel/commuting- Hinge mechanisms that will make you cringe every time you unfold the headphones. It was very obvious that there was an extremely limited number of times you could fold and unfold these before the hinges would give out. I was unsurprised to find that many long-term reviewers had this issue. Apple - there’s no reason why I should have to buy a new pair of headphones from you every 6 months because they’re so poorly constructed - particularly when they cost $300+!- The carrying case is inconveniently massive - these headphones should be able to fold down a whole lot better. Apple - see Bose QC headphones for a lesson on how headphone storage should be done.There are some positives, but they come with caveats as well.- Sound quality is good for a Bluetooth headphone, which is to say that it’s totally uninspiring by any standard set with wired phones. They have better bass than a pair of QC-25s, but they have much less of a soundstage, which often leaves them sounding a bit muddy.- I have a pair of 15 year old Koss Porta-Pros that sound better than these, and they were probably $50? Yeah, the technology has a way to go.- W1 chip - the headphones sync up quickly with an i-device, but no more so than any other wireless product made by any of the leading competitors. Not sure why people keep cheering about this aspect.- ANC noise cancellation - is better than previous iterations of this headphone, and yet still not on par with even the Bose QC headphones of yesteryear.- Design - kinda cool... in a 2000s sort of way. It’s 2018, maybe time for a refresh?In summary, these will be a great buy if Apple ever comes to it’s senses, and prices these “not terrible, not great” headphones closer to the $150-200 range.","Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2018",AE6CFIUTWRITI4J66P5OYGHE34BA,True,7,Color: Matte Black

I wanted something with noise cancellation that I could wirelessly pair with my phone (iPhone XS).Shipping was fast and the box arrived in great shape. I opened the box and found them to have their own carrying case, which they fold up nicely into. These also came with a charging cord and a aux cord to plug into whatever you want to listen to. Pairing them was as easy as turning them on and holding them near my phone. The phone recognized them almost instantly and I was ready to go.I’ve used these for about a couple weeks now have yet to have an issue with them going dead. I usually charge them at night and make sure they don’t ever go completely dead. The sound is awesome and I don’t believe I have ever owned a pair of headphones capable of producing this kind of sound. The one thing that I expected to be better was the noise cancelling abilities. Although it does help with some sound, it is not exactly noise canceling. With that said, it doesn’t take away from the fact that these are a great product.I would absolutely recommend these to anyone that is looking for a great pair of headphones that hold a charge well.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2019",AFNQ26MYAP4VJJC4NBDXLV37BA2A,True,1,Color: Midnight Black

I believed the reviewers hype and bought some Sony WH-1000s. The Sony headphones couldn't handle any bass, paused every time I touched them, wasn't the most comfortable. The frequency would go from low to high no apparent reason. They had too much technology for my need. Most of these new top headphones packed with tons of features are designed for leisure use, travel, and phone call purposes. But if you want to lose yourself in music at the gym they can't deliver the listening (studio) experience needed. I spent most of my time fumbling with the headphones than working out.Refunded the Sonys and re-upped on these DB Studios 3s. They go hard on my Android phone even though they are designed for Apple. Plus they are head turners and comfortable. Noise cancelling and phone calls are great. I didn't notice a huge difference from the Sonys.If your #1 want in headphones are sound quality, sound power, nouse cancelling, and comfort pick these joints.","Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2019",AGIQWGZDVOJCXKAX6NY4MYQCRBEA,True,1,

I was looking for a pair of headphones that had pretty much every feature the Bose set had, and then some. Which the Beats Studio 3 mostly cover, with 2 exceptions:1. The one feature that the Beats does not have that the Bose did have was the ability to connect to multiple devices via Bluetooth at once. With the Bose, I could connect to my laptop and my iPhone via Bluetooth, and if I was listening to music from my laptop while someone called, it would automatically switch to my iPhone. That feature was pretty neat, and one I definitely would like to have.2. The Beats seem to be a little tight on my head (maybe I just have a big head? idk). If I have the headphones on for an extended period of time, I end up with a throbbing headache. I'm hoping this will pass with time - either by me breaking in the Beats, or by the Beats slowly reshaping my head (kidding).Ultimately, the beats are a pretty decent by. The sound cancellation is pretty awesome, and the volume level seems to be much higher than my Bose could produce. If my second point above continues to persist, then I may have to return them and look for another pair that can accommodate my big a$$ head.-J","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2018",AGWLKWZOC6RFBPSZLXOV57QXUXTA,True,1,Color: Matte Black

R1XW8WWUYE494L,B07DHHXZRN,4.0 out of 5 stars Not What I Consider True Beats,The Badboy,4,"These, while still sounding great, don’t have that signature Beats bass push. It’s very slight. People have always bought Beats for their lean towards low end punch. These barely resemble the Beats of old. The noise cancellation works OK for highs and mids, but offer no low end help. So those trying to block out loud footsteps from an upstairs neighbor on wood floors may see little to jo benefit for anything other than the 500Hz and above ranges and only up to a certain DB. That’s not to say they aren’t great for those frequency ranges, as they totally eliminated any noise from my air handler which probably sits at 30-40 Db on the decibel scale. I also never hear neighbors voices, door slams or much of anything in those frequencies that these cover. Just the low end anything, like sub level sounds in the 20-400Hz range, these don’t work on.Overall, I’d say buy these at the $180 used/like new as I did. At that price, they are worth it. At $300, Id say no. As you aren’t getting that signature sound you are used to and the build quality is all plastic. For $300, you should be getting into aluminum or at least partial.The sound quality is good, but again without the push in low end... they can hardly be called Beats.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2019",AHJYHZOBOSEBCUCJNMHN5DPZ5DRQ,True,0,Color: Matte Black

By their design they block out outside noise and give clear detailed channel separation without fatiguing your ears over time. I don't need to use noise cancelling as the earphones do that by design.

R17L7OST6JYI6V,B07DHHXZRN,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones, but not amazing",Nick,3,"When you buy Beats, you either get them for the branding or because you assume expensive is better. As far as these go, i was in the latter. Overall, they're decent headphones. Good noise cancellation, the bluetooth is easy to connect and the charging is quick.However if you're looking for the BEST quality headphones for your money, these aren't them. The bass is nearly nonexistent, even when new. I just passed one year owning these, and while they're still holding up well enough, the signs of low quality construction are getting clearer. The faux leather padding has all but flaked off, leaving bits on the side of your head after you take them off. Whatever mechanism used to lock them in place to fit your head has broke on one side, letting the speaker part slide up and down freely, meaning every so often you have to push that side back up onto your head, even when stationary.As for the pros, they're still a quality pair of headphones. The sound quality, albeit not perfect, has stayed 100% consistent throughout this last year. They're incredibly comfortable to wear when they're newer, and have never made my head or ears sore from extended use. The bluetooth is easy to work, and they still come with a jack if you want to use them at a computer or have extra peace of mind in public. Noise cancellation works great, but will never completely drown out anything louder than a mid-size vacuum.Overall, i'm satisfied with them as headphones. Taking the price into account, however, leaves a fair amount to be desired. If you're interested in just the branding, then by all means these would be just fine, but if you're looking for a good, high quality, long term pair of headphones in this price range, you're better off doing a little more research and finding a different brand.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2019",AENCH6ZFGHDOTHJC7AZ7IGPQDLZA,True,0,Color: Defiant Black-Red

Controls are easy once figured out. Bluetooth range is excellent.Minues: Poor high end. Connection to Apple products is not always easy if going from Mac to phone. As with all over-the-ear products, they get hot to wear.Beats originally made their name by making bass heavy sounding headphones. They were terrible for listening to music. Apple purchased them and greatly improved on the original design.I have listened to these headphones using an iMac, iPhone and a LG TV. Surprisingly, they sound the best from the LG TV. Through the Apple products, the sound lacks the high end - what some would call the 'sizzle'. I have been able to counteract that somewhat by downloading and installing an App eqMac2. That helps to make acoustic guitar sound more 'alive'.The eq setup in Apple iOS (iPhone and iPad) is terrible, so I am looking for a similar app to help out there.I am at a loss as to why the sound from the LG TV sounds better than iTunes. I use 320 kbps for my MP3 rate in iTunes and it sounds great going directly to my sound system.Connecting to any BlueTooth device is easy and similar to any other product. If you have a non-Apple product, don't let anyone scare you away from these headphones. Surprisingly, I have more trouble connecting to the iPhone than my TV. That occurs after using them on my iMac.

Apple's W1 chip allows for me to be at opposite ends of a house and still hear my music. The ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) is, in my opinion, the best noise cancelling out there, simply because, when you're on a wired connection, it uses a tiny amount of battery to cancel noise. But that's not all. When you're wired, you can push the Beats logo (the button you'd normally use to pause and unpause when wireless), and the ANC CANCELS OUT WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING THE BUTTON! This allows me to talk to people with the headphones on. Beats are known for having terrible price per value, but at $219 for the Navy Blue pair, and the fact that prices drop often, you might be able to scoop some up for even $199 here on Amazon. And they finally have sound that's not ultra bassy, annoyingly high treble.

You can improve it with an equalizer, but the upper range is pretty bland sounding no matter what you do.The noise cancelling is pretty bad. It does block out a decent amount of airplane noise, but you can still hear people talking, street noises, etc, and the microphones pick up any slight breeze and pipe it in. You'll definitely get a lot of wind noise with ANC on.In terms of materials quality, everything looks nice. I really like the choice of plastic for the body – I got matte black. HOWEVER, the ear pads are total crap. They're some low-tier pleather material and started degrading at exactly 1 year. By the time it started really falling apart, getting black flakes everywhere it was out of warranty. I should have contacted support slightly sooner I guess, but you would expect $350 headphones to last more than 1 year without falling apart. Totally unacceptable. And Apple wasn't willing to budge on the warranty even after 3 hours on the phone.I got mine on sale for $200 – decent value for that price.

I already had a previous pair of noise canceling headphones which worked great for plane rides but the playback quality wasn't up to par.I ended up choosing the Beats due to pricing and the reviews. If you're looking for the best sound to go with these over the Bose. However if you want better ANC go with the Bose.This pair is very comfortable on my head and I'm able to wear them for hours without any discomfort. I like the fact that they are wireless and if the battery is to die you can just plug in the cable and keep on listening. They last about 22 hours with ANC on and nearly 40 hours without it turned on.The playback quality is nothing short of amazing. I'm very satisfied with my purchase as I am a musician myself and wanted a good pair of headphones for my studio/travel use.I highly recommend these to anyone not just because of the current price but for the product you get is definitely worth it.,"Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2018",AHZSRHHOW4U2VC6ZULVLK6W36BWQ,True,88,Color: Blue

Also the bass sounds are really nice but I feel like more vocal focused tracks suffer for it, they need to release software or something so you can change the sound quality for your preferences. I don’t know where all these 5 star reviews are coming from because these are not 5 star headphones. Also if you have any large ear piercings (industrial bars gauges etc) the pads really dig into them.","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2023",AE2FIOJQ7O2MGUP44FD6MR23NYFQ,True,0,Color: Defiant Black-Red

I am blown away at what a change they did in regards to the noise cancellation and it makes a huge difference to the overall sound.

R365383LCE2MYE,B07DHHXZRN,3.0 out of 5 stars Not for cold climates,tibor,3,"I bought these primarily for use on planes and for that I've been happy with them. They fit my head well (though they might be a bit tight for those with larger heads), noise canceling works well enough to not be annoyed by a crying baby in the next row, and the sound is good. I am not an audiophile, so others may differ on the sound, but they are good enough for me. The somewhat bizarre issue I have run into now that the weather has started getting cold is that the headphones shut themselves off when the weather is below freezing. They last about 5 minutes in anything under 25 degrees or so. This seems to be a planned ""feature"" and not an issue with just my headphones. But those of us who live in colder climates (I'm in MN) have just as many devices as those in warm climates, and this is the first time I've encountered one that shuts off. Everything else I own can handle the cold just fine so I'm not sure what the design issue is that makes these not work. Had I known of this, ""feature"" before I bought them, I would have gone with a different brand. That said, for my primary use of travel they are fine and were significantly cheaper and fit my head better than comparable bose or sony. Just something for people in could climates to be aware of if you plan to wear them outside.","Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2018",AEVBY2ZHE5PDAP3JYFYA7EKTUKHA,True,1,Color: Matte Black

The music isn't simply pounding into your ears, it's floating somewhere behind the ears; it's like being in a private concert. The noise cancelling feature out performs all the others we tried, which was our primary reason for wanting headsets. We tried several other less expensive brands, and my husband settled on one of those for the ANC, until he listened through my set of Beats. I needed a smaller sized headset and everyone I tried slid off my head. The Beats actually stay on; that's why I chose them, because of the tighter fit. After comparing the ANC feature, my husband also exchanged his cheaper set for these. You couldn't pry these away from me, I am that impressed. They do cost way more, but that's also what you get.

RF57IW54W7KPN,B07DHHXZRN,5.0 out of 5 stars Great set of headphones. Comfortable and music sounds great through them.,Wing Wong,5,"This is the third ""Beats Headset"" in our household. The other two are still in use, just by other members of the family. (each prior generation gets passed down/etc).But I had been using a pair of generic padded headphones while my wife was using the Beats Solo2 and recently upgraded to the Beats Solo3. I found them to be comfortable, but wanted larger ear cups since I didn't like pressure on my ears too much. So when Prime Day rolled around, I picked up a pair of these on sale. Nice.So, my impressions:Package: top notch. Typical Apple minimalism, fit and finish. The only thing I would nit pick is that the headphones were collapsed inside of the egg shaped hardshell, so one of the ear pads had dented a bit due to being constantly pressed against the inside of the arch. Not a problem, but just a nit pick.Comfort: the ear pads were not large enough to completely encompass my ears. However, they are more comfortable, for me, vs the Solo3. So definitely a plus if your head/ears are a bit bigger. This will help.Setup: Turn it on by holding down the power button... place near an Apple device, and it shows up. Accept the pairing and you're good to go. It was painless and worked just like with the AirPods.Sound quality: After having spent a good deal of time exposed to high frequency sounds(data centers) I think that I'm not a good judge of ""awesome sound reproduction"". The padded cups and the tweaking that Apple/Beats did definitely causes the output of the headphones to favor the lower end of the audio spectrum. So things of a strong deep thump nature will definitely be felt. The higher frequency sounds sounded alright for several of the pieces I played. The mids feels a bit muddied, but that could be due to either the heavy bass-leaning configuration or the dampening effect of the headset and the ANR.Ambient Noise Reduction: so I didn't know this, but each time you turn these on, the noise reduction is turned on by default. I had the headsets on for a while with no music playing, and wondered how to turn it on, when I read that it starts by default. You can disable it after powering it up with a double push of the power button or from the bluetooth device info screen on your IOS device. When this happens, there is a beep/tone to indicate a state change, a momentary dip in audio output from the internal change, and then all of a sudden, I heard a humming sound. I thought they were defective and then realized that it was the sound of the HVAC in the room. .... I had never even noticed it. I spent a few minutes walking around the room and seeing how it worked, turning it on and off again. Basically, it seems like it measures and figures out the frequencies of the surroundings and then counters those frequencies. There IS a noticeable drop. Box fan in one room... can definitely hear it. Turn on ANC and then it dips down to a very very quiet repeating whoosh whoosh. The music when played like this feels more like music being listened to in a quieter room. It's definitely not just white noise.Heat: I can see how the design might result in sweaty ears. :) And I don't see myself running/jogging with these. But then again, they aren't Beats Jugging Headphones. They are studio headphones. So I'll leave the running music activities to my Air Pods... and let's face it, if I'm out on the sidewalk/etc, I WANT to be aware of my surroundings.All in all, I really like them. I went with matte black mainly because it was nice and plain.Update: after a week of use, really liking this headset. I can get about three nights if sleep use out of it before needing to recharge. I think that for people who are sensitive to noise when they sleep, the ANC is great for giving you that “quiet room” experience. If you want to play a little very quiet music or white noise over the ANC, that works too. Really cool.Love not having to deal with a cord when I’m listening to music and working at my computer.Haven’t used the headset mode more than a few times, but seems okay.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2018",AHUP6NEYH4NFUZN4UJIK7EMUGC2Q,True,33,Color: Matte Black

This 3rd pair however is a bit differentI love beets music headsets! They are terrific they fit really well and are a great value for the money and how long they last and the sound quality but this particular set ... Maybe it's just my Headset but there's something off about the sound.Their noise canceling is good the base is terrific but it's kind of missing the mid... Maybe a little more Treble?Something odd too that I wouldn't have expected is that the battery now has to be charged twice A-day instead of once and they can understand that because it's not plugged into the phone like my other headset was so as not draining off the battery but keeping the Bluetooth connection on seems to drain the battery faster and I don't understand that at all as it's just not something you'd expect to be a drain on the battery.Beats is always put out a very high quality product but since Apple purchased it... It seems it's made a little cheaper and quality than the last 2 pairs I have hadThe headband feels a little more flexible and that troubles me because I don't want to see these things break. The only time any of the ones I had broke was the 1st pair that's because I was pulling it out of my kid's hand he was 19 or 20 at the time.I'm hoping it's a better made product increasing in its quality versus Apple cutting corners and causing problems where there were noneI find it very sad that doctor Dre gave up this company for the money I can't imagine any other reason someone would sell such a quality company with a great brand and outstanding products when the company it was sold to cares very little about the quality of Music itself. Sure they sell music online but they're not musicians! I used to be. The quality of the sound really matters to me which is why I bought these in the 1st place. Beats music also had the number one online music source in my opinion but as soon as doctor Dre left it it went downhill and then sold outSo I can say that these are really great headphones and I still haven't heard any others that are as good as these but in fact have tried many others trying them in this store and the sound didn't come close to the quality of beats music. Honestly not even close. If I needed a pair of headphones and didn't have the money for these I would save as long as I had to to buy a pair of these instead of just settling on something else because I would not enjoy the experience as much as I do with this headset. Should I say this brand?All in all it is an expensive purchase. Seeing that it's expensive you have to decide for yourself whether hearing music as it was meant to be heard as important to you. It is to me. It's an investment in your entertainment and it's so worth while one.I cannot recommend this headset any higher but to say if you can find the beats music studio to version in new condition which would be very rare indeed.

R209Y25IYHUF0A,B07DHHXZRN,4.0 out of 5 stars Studio3 is Pretty Solid - Would Love to See USB-C Instead of Micro USB,Jonathan Tittle,4,"Let me start by saying that I am not an audiophile and this is an honest review from someone who needs a reliable pair of headphones for a range of day-to-day activities, which happens to include listening to music. Prior to purchasing the Studio3 headphones, I was using Apples own AirPods (v1). To replace them as a daily driver, I needed three things from a pair of headphones:1). Better sound quality, and ANC (active noise canceling);2). Better Bluetooth connectivity in an area where my MacBook and Mac Mini are surrounded by metal (introducing some interference);3). Faster connection and easier swapping between devices (MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV)SOUND QUALITYI listen to a wide range of music--from rap to rock to nature sounds; as a part of my job, I'm in and out of video chats (hangouts, meet, etc). Overall, the Studio3 headphones work as expected regardless of what I'm using them for and the microphone is clear.The sound quality of the Studio3 headphones, however, is not noticeably better or worse than headphones I've used at lower price points. If you can catch a deal on the Studio3 as I did, it makes the price point a little more tolerable. At nearly $350 at the time of this review, sound quality should not be the main reason you purchase them if your use case is the same or similar to mine.BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITYThis is really where the Studio3 headphones shine! In comparison to AirPods and similar Bluetooth devices, Apples W1 chip is amazing and keeps you connected. With my existing setup, my Mac Mini is in a server rack made of solid steel and despite every other Bluetooth device dropping less than 10ft (3.05 m) away, thanks to the W1 chip, the Studio3 remain connected even with walls between the headset and the Mac Mini. I was able to roam about 25ft (7.62 m) to 30ft (9.14 m) before they started to drop.DEVICE SWAPPINGWhile this is likely due to the ecosystem (Apple), the Studio3 pair near instantly with any device I've tested. While paired to my Mac Mini, I can quickly pair to my Apple TV, iPad, or iPhone in seconds. For comparison, the AirPods are quick, though seem to get ""confused"" in a way that prevents them from being able to do the same at the same speed.CHARGE / CHARGINGThe Studio3 headphones easily get me through an entire day of work and then some on a single charge, with ANC enabled. I'm a bit disappointed to see that despite Apple moving to USB-C on the MacBook, Mac Mini, and the newest iPad, the Studio3 still uses USB-A to micro USB. USB-C should be the standard on a $350+ device. Unless you have an adapter (USB-A => USB-C), you'll need another charger to charge the headphones. This is a burden honestly as it adds to what I need to carry.OVERALLThe Studio3 headphones get a pretty solid 4 stars. What really prevents them from being 5-Star, in my opinion, boils down to two things:1). Use of micro USB instead of USB-C, and;2). The ear pads are not leatherFor what I need them to do, they work extremely well and beat out AirPods in every way imaginable. Yes, in comparison to AirPods, they are bulkier, though it's a small price to pay for something that works better.","Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2019",AGPCZ7SNUN5Q3A4M3AT76RMXU2CQ,True,8,Color: Matte Black
R2XG4BLDC0WE4Z,B07DHHXZRN,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Purchase,Amazon Customer,5,"First off, this review is by someone who had always used earbuds, and one pair of Skullcady Hesh 2 Wireless Headphones. This product is definitely a step up from both of those, but that is expected considering the price. But, I believe these are worth the high price. The sound is very good for casual music listening and Netflix/YouTube. I am not a fan of huge bass when listening to music, and the bass on these are not too crazy. The noice cancellation is great, but I personally rarely use it. It kills the battery much faster than when it is off(when off it lasts the 40 hours advertised, when on it only lasts 3-4 hours). It definitely shouldn’t be used when there isn’t much sound to cancel. Without the noice cancellation on, the headphones still do a good job of keeping the sound from leaking so others can hear you, and keeping you from hearing things around you. You can still hear your surroundings, but not as well. The battery outside of using the noice cancellation is amazing. I charge the headphones once or twice a week, and I use them a lot. Not only that, it only takes about 2 hours to charge from 0%! The headphones also look great, which you expect when looking at Beats, as they are a status symbol when it comes to headphones. Finally, I’ll speak on the durability. I’ve had them since November(it is February when I am writing this so I may update this in the future) and use them often, yet I have had no issues with anything breaking or malfunctioning. The closest thing to that is sometimes the headphones will be on but stop playing sound, and to fix it I just have to turn them off and back on. However, this has happened twice in the countless hours I’ve been using them. I’d recommend waiting for them to go on sale for around $280 since they are on sale for that price somewhat often. I got them for that price and am estatic with that decision. I only wish I decided to make the purchase sooner(I started considering getting these in June of last year, I just take a loooong time making expensive decisions).","Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2019",AHJP7GD5ABUVV26VLDFOVMDP6JPA,True,2,Color: Matte Black

R3BL71F43SO0A3,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars These are awesome for ears that stick out,dacia hutson,5,"I was doing research to see if any manufacturers made nice headphones for those whose ears stick out. What happens is after an hour of wearing regular headphones (not 80s/90s style), the extra cartilage in the back starts to hurt a lot and you need to take a break from the headphones.Well, the Sony headphones are the most I’ve ever paid. I avoided buying Beats for that reason in the past. However, when I saw the shape of the Sony and the positive reviews related to my predicament, I just went for it.I’m so glad I did. First, the expensive price offers so much than I would have imagined. You have to download the Sony headphones app to link these to your device. Once you do,There are many options for sound effects, for noise canceling, ambience, turning off automatically if the phones are removed, pausing if you start talking, etc.THE NOISE CANCELLATION CHANGED MY QUALITY OF LIFE. I live in a thin walled, thin ceiling condo apartment neighborhood. I can sleep with these ALL night without pressure on my ears, and beautiful white noise with the outer world noises 90% gone. Wow. I’m so glad these exist. Oh, not only that, but they last up to 18 hours.

R1P3AXUG7YP4RA,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Headaches after 1 hour of use but sound quality and connectivity were a win,nin,4,"I gave these a try as my primary work headset, with my key priorities being comfort and connectivity. Sound quality was important, but not a deciding factor. These checked most of the boxes; they sounded great and had the a very stable connection (0 issues during my trial of this set), but the comfort for some reason wasn't there.For the price, I was hoping I could wear this headset for 5-6 hours without issue during my work day, but they fell far short. I don't know why, but after 1 hour of use I consistently had a headache. I tried for several days over several calls and had the same result without any indiciation that it would improve, and since the goal of these was work calls over Teams and Zoom, I could not keep them.There are definite pros to this set though and I'm sure it's a me thing as far as why I was getting headaches (tons of reviews dispute my personal findings). The audio quality over BT was exceptional. I found it odd that it wouldn't work over USB-C while it charged, but maybe that's not an industry standard thing (my last headset did this so I got used to it). The connectivity was incredible; no issues with dropping during calls and very fast reconnecting. Handled multiple devices flawlessly. The app was nice. Overall I liked it but could not justify keeping it at this price when I couldn't wear it more than 1 hour.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AF7PDLMEJIQEYUD4BSNYE774ZS6Q,True,0,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R20CYL54OHFDCZ,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Can Hear Any Noise You Want,Tian,5,"After two years using the headphone, here is my review and thoughts.Pros:The WH-1000XM5 has very good battery life. I'm never anxious about even after two years.Sounds quality are pretty good than the WH-1000XM4. Usually the Noise Canceling has the sound quality issue. The sound is like listen music under water. But the WH-1000MX5 is not.Cons:Terrible Noise Canceling. The headphone has ANC (auto-noise-canceling) feature which automatically adjust noise canceling based on environment noise. It sounds like a cool feature but the reality is when the noise is not loud enough, the headphone will not work hard to cancel the noise. It only works based on what it think NC is enough for you, not your feeling. As a result you can hear almost all the noises from environment. People talking, AC, car from the street, even the fan in the bathroom. The noise canceling effect just like put some toilet paper in your ear.How about turn off the ANC and user adjust the canceling by themselves?You can do it in older version of WH-1000 series but not for MX5. It has been two years and tons of people complain about it in all the forums but SONY still choose to ignore it.So currently, the best way to use WH-1000XM5 is with a 33dB NRR soft earplugs.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2024",AE4GEDINUOUMYC3VZQEG6CCXJX2A,True,1,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

The Sony headphones' connectivity are not as seamless as I'd assume AirPod Maxes would be with Apple products.

But, these headphones are a much better value than the Apple AirPods Maxes so I'm willing to overlook that minor inconvenience. Overall, I love them.

RM1Q7FEWXKB10,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Review After 2 Months,Andrew,4,"Quick take aways:Without an EQ, the headphones have a very very dark sound signature (I was not a fan)Sound very good for Bluetooth headphones with EQ, sound okay when wiredANC seems to be decent, lot of customisability in the appANC works well in standalone mode (without pairing)Battery life is goodNo form of sweat/water resistance is a minus but can be worked aroundHigh noise floor (if you care about that sort of thing)Optional pause with take off and resume with put on feature is amazing!As a preface, the Sony WH-1000XM5 are my first set of ANC headphones. I would consider myself a mild audiophile (I have a DAC, AMP, and too many headphones). With that said, everyone's ears are different so take this with an extra pinch of salt.Out of the box experience: The packaging was quite nice. It included a hard-shell carrying case, USB-C to USB-A charging cable, 1.2m long 3.5mm cable, and the headphones. The connection process for new devices is wonky and leaves a bit to be desired. The initial pairing did not work until I installed the Sony Headphones Connect app from the appstore. After this, you have to power off the device then power on and hold the power button for 5 seconds to enter pairing mode (confirmed by a vocal ""pairing"" from the headphones). The sound signature left a lot to be desired. For a bit of background, my favourite type of headphone is flat/neutral with a balanced sound signature. I enjoy heavy bass in electronic music and am sensitive to loud highs/mids (I get listener fatigue quite fast from it). I enjoy a lot of variety when listening to music an will try most things out. In particular I regularly listen to Classical, Avant-garde, Experimental, Easy listening, Electronic, Contemporary folk, Latin, Jazz, Rock, and some Traditional folk. I don't tend to listen to much Blues, Rap, or Hip Hop. I occasionally listen to mainstream-Pop and Country.Without EQ, the sound signature is very very dark. The bass is very punchy and present, the mids are recessed, and the highs have their edge taken off. I was not a fan of it for anything but electronic tracks with no vocals and heavy bass. Even then, it wasn't particularly amazing. Anything with vocals will sound horrendous (again, with no EQ) as the bass frequencies in voices will be very pronounced. The ANC worked well for me out of the box. For the open mode, I set it to let near voices through and ambient noise out. I use them with eyeglasses but the ANC still seems to work well. They do a particularly good job of filtering out A/C noises, the electronic whine that appliances generate (not all people can hear this), and running water. The ANC tends to struggle with erratic high pitched noises (as I understand it, most ANC systems do). However, it will dull the noise a tad through both the closed back headphone and ANC component.Adaptations Since I was not a fan of the sound profile out of the box, I set up an EQ profile with these headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect app includes an EQ but I found it to be extremely limited in terms of customisability (I did not like any of the presets that were offered) and not very user friendly. Due to this, I set up my own external EQ using AutoEq (on github) as a starting point. After fine tuning it to my preferences, using the headphones became a much much better experience. They sound very good for Bluetooth headphones. For genres where I like more bass, I strongly prefer the Sony headphones over my Sennheiser and prefer the Sony to my Bose. In wired mode, the headphones definitely sound better but no where near as good as my other wired headphones. If I'm attached to a wire, I would rather just switch to another pair of headphones. With that said, they do sound better if you leave the headphones on while connected with a cable. The ANC works well for me. If I use them for noise canceling without music, it can get unsettlingly quiet in the mornings (which is a great thing). Around others, particularly in the kitchen, the headphones do a very good job of dulling and eliminating noises. The pass through function works well in the event of conversation. I am a very quiet eater but these headphones did a great job canceling out all noises while I ate. I don't use these headphones outside, so I do not know how well they perform with nature's noises. The gesture controls included are useful but a bit too involved to be my go to. If I have physical access to my device, I prefer to use that to control the music. However, the pause on take off feature is amazing! It consistently pauses my media any time I have to take my headphones off and resumes right where it left off and soon as I put it on. Simply magic is the only way I have to explain it (the function can be turned off if you don't like/want it).","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2023",AE5DD5GYEJZMSBJWNIOSVPJ7VSUA,True,132,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R3IO6AFXH4Q3QQ,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars I love these headphones so much I returned my Senheisers for them,Tyler,5,"I initially bought the Senheiser momentum 4 when I was looking for a new pair of headphones. When I put them on, I was wildly disappointed because they didn't even compare to my old Sony 1000-XM3. When comparing those two I realized the XM3 had significantly better noise canceling, so I figured I should upgrade to the 1000-XM5. It is definitely an upgrade to the old pair. The sound quality is slightly improved but overall very good sound quality to the point where you start to dislike hearing music playing from other speakers or headphones. The noise canceling is top notch when combined with the sound of music or a movie playing. It makes the sound of the engines on a plane almost disappear, and any kind of ambient noise that you would hear in day to day is completely gone. Again this is also an improvement to previous models. Another great feature that is added is automatically powering off when it senses that they are taken off. This can significantly increase the amount of time you can go before having to charge again because older models would only automatically power off when the Bluetooth disconnected. In that case it wasn't really helpful for when you're wearing them to sleep.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AH6G5XVJDUGNPG7KDDAPF736ID3Q,True,1,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

However, durability remains a concern, so handle with care. Comfort: 3.2/5Comfort was the biggest issue for me. My sensitive ears heat up quickly, and the pressure/fit, combined with the cup material, doesn't allow my ears to breathe. Consequently, it becomes uncomfortable to wear these for long periods.

R1QDJ6PZICT8D2,B0BXYCS74H,2.0 out of 5 stars These had so much potential...,GarthVader,2,"There's A LOT to love about the Sony WH-1000XM5. I really wanted to write a rave review on them. Unfortunately I've also had a series of horrible problems that make them impossible to recommend.I'll start with the good. 1) These have the best ANC (active noise cancellation) on the consumer market right now. I also have Airpods Max and have compared with a freind's top of the line Bose QC Ultra. These put both to shame when it comes to ANC. It's incredible. Like so good it's almost dangerous.... I kinda worry I wouldn't hear a fire alarm going off while listening to music with these lol. I should note though, that to get this ANC performance you have to make sure there's nothing between the earpads and your head, like a hat or bunched up hair. My metal framed glasses don't make a difference, but my chunkier plastic frames let a bit more noise through 2) The battery life is amazing. I've been getting 24-28 hours of use with ANC on for each charge. They also charge fast - for me it's typically 45 minutes to go from zero to fully charged. For fast charging you do need a quality USB-C cable (I use Anker cables - they're excellent and very affordable). When I used a cheap crappy cable it took over 2 hours. 3) They're incredibly light-weight and very comfortable. I almost forget I'm wearing them. The ergonomics make them feel like they're custom made for my head and the ear pads and head band are the softest I've ever felt on headphones. The build is pretty plasticky, but they still feel well made / durable... and I think it's worth it for the weight reduction it allows. 4) Like any Bluetooth noise canceling headphones you're not getting hi-fi audio quality, but its better than most other bluetooth headphones. It's not as good as Airpods Max, but better than Bose and any of the cheaper bluetooth headphones I've tried. The most notable weakness is some muddiness in the lower frequencies, in my experience. 5) The case it comes with is awesome. It's a bit bulky, but it keeps the headphones very well protected and has a small compartment that you can keep a charging cable or 3.5mm audio cable in (which you can use for a wired connection if the battery dies, if the device you're using has a headphone jack). It's also very nice aesthetically. Overall the case puts Apple's Airpods Max case to absolute shame - that one barely covers half of the headphones, so it's worthless for protection. I'd honestly throw it away, but Apple is a dick and decided to make it so the headphones are always on and using battery unless you put them in their crappy case. 6) If you download the mobile app, there are tons of options to customize your experience. You can change the EQ, turn speak-to-chat on/off (disables ANC when it detects you're speaking to someone), choose your priority between sound quality vs. stable bluetooth connection, allow to connect to 2 devices simultaneously, integrate Siri or Amazon Alexa, customize controls, and a bunch of other things.Okay, now the problems. 1) A week after I bought them the speaker in the right ear started randomly making a loud buzzing/popping noise periodically. It's not all the time, but pretty frequent and very annoying. It happens for about 30 seconds a few times every hour of use. Sony claims it happens in places where ultrasonic waves are used to eliminate rodents and suggests you turn off ANC to prevent it... which is aggravating. ANC is the only thing that makes these worth such a high price tag and Sony is the only brand with that problem. Also, I'm 90% sure their explanation doesn't even apply to my environment. 2) Just two weeks after I bought them the touch controls started FREAKING OUT, detecting gestures when I wasn't even touching them. It rapidly flips between playing and pausing my music, skip songs, flip between enabling/disabling voice-to-chat, etc. all on its own, making them entirely unusable when that happens. It happens every hour or two, and once it starts it continues until I turn them off and back on. When I contacted Sony about this, they advised me to just disable gesture controls in the app. That prevents it from pausing or skipping my music, but it does not turn off the pinging sound the headphones make when a a tap/gesture id detected, so you still hear rapid random pinging whenever it decides to bug out. SUPER annoying. 3) 4 weeks after I bought them they just turned off on their own suddenly 10 minutes after I finished charging them to 100% and would not turn back on. I tried a factory reset and they still wouldn't turn on. after repeatedly trying to turn them on, they finally did... for a second, but shut down right after connecting them to my device. I figured they were completely busted, but when I tried again a few hours later they started working again and were fine for a few day... then it happened again. No idea what the deal is, but it's happened 4 times now, so I need to send to Sony to see if they'll fix them. Based on past experience trying to use Sony's warranty for repairs on other products though, they're probably going to send them right back and claim nothing is wrong because it didn't happen during their 30-second inspection.To summarize, these are SO CLOSE to being the best wireless ANC headphones to buy right now IMO. I really love them when they work... whenever I have to use my much more expensive Airpods Max, they make me wish I were using the XM5s minus all the issues. When they work, I prefer almost everything about the XM5 over the airpods. Unfortunately they're ruined by a few really bad problems. I would recommend getting the WH-1000XM4 instead. They have the same noise cancelling performance and most of the other great qualities and haven't been plagued with bugs.

I cannot imagine wearing these throughout a 4+ hour airplane flight.But that's part of the extremely effective noise reduction.The app's server connection was unreliable for me, and the login process far to ""secure"" with difficult capcha matches, and after each failure, one's password must be re-entered. But you don't need the app for excellent function.Positives:- Outstanding microphone noise cancellation. This is active all the time, whether or not ANC is on for listening. Speaking over to phone from a coffee shop (ceiling music, arguing staff, dishes clanking, a family conversation and squalling baby 15 feet away), the listener could hear little or no background noise.It is very, very hard to get any information on actual performance on noise-canceling mics in buds or headphones. I finally found soundboys-dot-com, who way down near the bottom of their reviews have actual recordings in standardized noisy environments.I've slowly migrated, over 6 years, through three units: First, an ANC open-ear headset with a boom mic that I assumed would work well because close to my mouth. My wife casually observed that I spoke very loudly when dictating, especially. I wrongly thought this because we don't hear our own voice well when our ears are covered. Then I forgot these on the train, and bought Beats for convenience -- the band and magnetic latches in the buds make loss difficult. These surprised me by having MUCH better mic performance -- never needed to raise my voice in a quiet environment for good speech recognition. But in noisy environments (riding in a car or airplane. sitting an an airport waiting area, cafe, etc.), they failed. With dictation, I had to cup my hand over my mouth and the mic to avoid unseemly shouting, and then quickly hold the mic in my hand to suppress the noise during my silences. It's interesting to me that voice recognition works better with ANC off, because then I hear my own speech volume more accurately and can modulate that realistically. Yes, one does need to speak louder in a very noisy environment, or simply talk into one's hand to reflect the sound back to the mics when one wants to be private. These Sony headphones are exactly what I need.For me, the excellent music quality is simply the frosting on the cake. - One can plug in a standard mini stereo plug and the phones just work.. (There are stereo to USB adapters readily available.)","Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2024",AHIHTL4O3CIE2AWYZX7BF6KMG4RA,True,3,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R1SZPJ7YA17UMK,B0BXYCS74H,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great ANC, Passthrough, and Audio Quality, but less comfortable and missing previous features",Kyle Zdunski,4,"I'm no audiophile, just a bit more picky than most people, but you can find resources online with exact specifications about the audio quality. They're certainly the best sounding headphones I've ever gotten.I own both the previous models, the WH-1000XM3 & XM4, and the quality of the sound, noise cancelling, and passthrough mode has gotten better with each iteration. The passthrough on these compared to the XM4's now feels lile night and day, as these allow me to hear my surroundings far better.However, I have had a few small issues with these. The redesign of the headphone strap looks and feels more modern with a higher build quality than the previous versions, and they're slightly lighter, but they're a bit more uncomfortable to wear for long periods. The strap is thinner, so the pressure on the top of my head is spread out over a smaller area, which begins to hurt after a couple hours if I don't wear a hat or hood to spread out the weight a bit. This is also somewhat avoidable by simply adjusting their position on my head every once in a while.One advantage these have over previous models is the ability to seamlessly switch between two connected devices, but this has it's issues. I use a Samsung phone and a Windows PC, so results may vary, but often the computer will just take control of the headphones despite not playing anything. For example, I double tap the right ear cup to pause something playing on my phone, then a few seconds later, do the same to resume it. For some reason, the headphones often decide to switch control to the computer during that brief pause window, resuming whatever was playing on it, or just doing nothing at all if nothing was playing. This happens even if all the audio on the PC is muted, no programs are open, and no media is or was playing.The XM4's had a handy solution for switching devices: NFC. I could hold my phone up to the headphones to quickly connect & disconnect it, making switching between devices quick even though only one could be connected at a time. I always knew which device the headphones were currently controlling. However, much to my surprise, the XM5's completely lack any NFC functionality. This would be fine, if connecting to two devices at once didn't have this issue. It's not a dealbreaker, though, as I just have to remember to disconnect them from my PC when I get up, or spend a few extra seconds getting my phone out of my pocket every time I want to resume something I was listening to.If you get these, here's a tip: don't clip your nails in passthrough mode. Something about the sound of clipping nails causes the passthrough mode to make a loud, high-frequency noise and shut off for about a second. This also happens for some other loud sounds, but clipping nails consistently causes it.In conclusion, I do believe that the XM5's were a worthy upgrade for me from the 4's. The improvements in noise cancellation are a godsend when there's constant noise around the house, which is all the time. I do wish there were an option to turn off the weird adjustments the ANC makes sometimes to try to adapt to the environment, as occasionally it will try to adjust each ear individually, resulting in a weird pressure sensation in my head due to the uneven audio cancelling.","Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2024",AGRX6WBOY2N4OUUYQ7WYTBZPZEPQ,True,27,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R3C9FB6LLL4I7I,B0BXYCS74H,3.0 out of 5 stars Headphones are Mediocre,b,3,"*Disclaimer: I bought mine used ""like new"" or ""very good""I bought these because they're rated one of the best headphones on the market, I HIGHLY disagree. Are they bad headphones? No. Are they worth the money? No, not even on sale lol. I returned mine and bought the Sony WH-1000XM4, and here's why:**Noise Cancellation (6/10): This feature was ok at best. The Apple AirPods Max are still top of the line for noise cancellation - I hear nothing when I wear them. With the Sony WH-1000XM5, I can still hear a lot of sounds around me. I'd say it cuts out maybe 60-70% of noise. My biggest issue here was that the noise cancellation would turn off randomly - so I would have to manually turn on/off the noise cancellation and ambient noise, which was just irritating.**Sound Quality (7/10): Sound quality was fine, it was nothing exceptional. The first day I received them, something really weird happened and the sound went completely muffled - like I was underwater. I looked up the issue and there have been similar issues for other customers who bought these headphones. The sounds went back to normal the next day, but I was already skeptical about their performance.**Comfort (9/10): I think they were really comfortable. I wear plastic framed glasses, so headphones that work with them can be a mission. The Apple AirPods Max do not work with my glasses at all, they pinch my frames and move them around - I need to wear contacts with them. With the Sony WH-1000XM5, this really isn't an issue. I needed to adjust my glasses every once in a while, but maybe once in like 3 hours. I think they're one of the best fitting headphones for people with glasses. Also, when I went to adjust the headband portion to make them shorter/tighter, they would slip - they just would not stay adjusted to where I needed them (this could be because I bought them slightly used, so it could have just been from previous wear - but still an issue if they become loose over time).**Product Quality (6/10): The headphones themselves are cheap plastic and just feel flimsy. For almost $400, you would expect them to feel a little better or more sturdy. I was constantly worried I was going to break them. The case is nice and hard, and I personally think they store nicely and are easy to travel around with. I bought the beige ones (again, I bought them slightly used), but the case was dirty and it stains easily since it's made of cloth material. The foam on the ear part is very soft, so it's kind of just your preference there. I think they felt a little cheap, but I also think that they added to the comfort.**Battery Life (9/10): The battery life is fine, they last pretty long. I'm studying for the Bar right now, so I used them for about 10 hours a day. They would last like a little over 10 hours for me before needing to be charged, and charging only took max 3 hours.**Connectivity (5/10): I had huge problems with connecting them to my Mac, I have no clue why. But, just so everyone knows, you need to download the app (Sony Connect) to connect it to your phone and your other devices. They just weren't discoverable on my Mac. I restarted my laptop and the the headphones, downloaded the app, connected them to my iPhone, updated my Mac, etc. It took me like 2 hours to get them connected to my laptop. I'm not sure if I am just technologically challenged or if they just aren't compatible with Apple products, but this process alone made me feel rage that I never thought I would feel.**Aesthetic (7/10): The headphones looked ok on. The ear part was kinda too clunky for my liking. They stick out a little more than other headphones, so I kind of felt like a bear when I wore them.**Overall (7.5/10): I think the headphones are meh. I just wasn't impressed for headphones that are rated sooooo highly in every article online. I did a lot of research and was torn between Sony WH-1000XM5, Sony WH-1000XM4, and the Bose QuietComfort 45. I decided against the Bose only because you cannot turn on/off the noise cancellation with buttons. So between the XM4 and XM5, I picked the XM5 because they were rated so well in online articles, I liked the look of them more (from pictures), and I figured I would just get the most up-to-date model. I returned them mainly because of the connectivity problems, noise cancellation, and sound quality. I just don't think they're worth the money, especially retail price. I just got the Sony WH-1000XM4 and they are SO MUCH BETTER. The sound/product quality, noise cancellation, connectivity, etc.Final Thoughts: If you want top of the line headphones and have the money to spend, get the Apple Airpods Max. If you want great headphones for a better price, Sony WH-1000XM4. The Bose are apparently SUPER comparable to the Sony WH-1000XM4 and are cheaper in price too. So, if having buttons to turn on/off noise cancellation is irrelevant to you, then get the Bose QuietComfort 45.The end.","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2023",AFWRUIE4QDPQYPQOK3LVEKELRT4A,True,76,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

REW7IJXPA0PZ9,B0BXYCS74H,"5.0 out of 5 stars Smaller heads, folks with hair, and sensitive temples..read this",Bast,5,"First off, I havent had a chance to test all functionality yet. I am coming here in hopes of helping someone else out with their frustration.If you're nervous about dropping the money, do it. The app (if you let it) will track your usage. Get them, set an alert for a day or two before the return period is up. Try them out and then check your usage when the alarm goes off. If you need/use headphones I almost guarantee youre going to find these worth it.RE: Small headsYour head might not be too small. I realized after two days of use I was fitting them more like traditional headphones and they were siting on one or two lobes very slightly.When you fit, and while you get used to putting them on, I suggest:- lengthening the headand (as app suggests)- 'scooping' your ears lobes up and inside the pads rather than under them at all- then gently fitting headbandOnce I started doing this my fit issues nearly dissappeared(hair..). Biggest issue now is the band material is not grippy at all and I have very smooth/slick hair, so it wiggles a bit. If I troubleshoot around this I will update.Of note and Re:Sensitive TemplesThese do not need to be as secure over all (other than having the suction over the ears) as you will not want these to get wet, period. These are not designed for exercise or heavy movement. They are sufficiently set for walking around or hanging out, this protects you from losing suction without significant pressure on your temples and keeps these super light headphones EXTREMELY comfortable. Which for someone like me that gets migraines with nearly ANY temple pressure has been... life changing.The suction aspect for proper noise cancelation is fairly fundamental. It's an even bigger deal with these as they'll adjust sound and I could see if suction was lost at an inopportune moment it could be...uncomfortable.RE: HairY'all, your hair is going to need to be out of the way. I have already noticed that one or two small strands will absolutely affect the seal. I won't notice it immediately but when I move around or talk I'll notice a sound change (almost like a varying level of wubba womp like entering a tunnel or in elevation changes) and at the corresponding ear I'll find hair between my ear and headphones. If you experience this in one or both ears...check for anything preventing a seal! It's annoying to navigate but as with adjusting the fit as above the more I do it, the easier it is to do upfront/as second nature.The app is fairly easy to navigate but has a small learning curve, nothing atronimical. The only other app ive used for headphones was Jabra about 2 years ago. Theyve likely updated since but compared to the 2020 Jabra app..this app is night and day better in terms of navigation and ease of use.So far my only con has been switching between my TV and my phone. This could be me, I think this may just be a learning curve I havent yet had time to solve. What it was doing: Paired to both. Switched to phone to do some Duolingo. For some reason any adjustment i made unpaused my TV and swapped where the sound was coming from. When I re-paused my TV I'd have to reselect my phone..and then it would do this again. So for now Im just leaving the TV unpaired. I mostly dont need this anyway but thought it might be nice for my neighbors late at night.Summation without even talking about its sound quality, noise cancelation and other functions (which are amazing):These headphones are worth the price tag for the lack of weight on my temples ALONE. Everything else is icing on the cake.If something changes I will absolutely return here to update.","Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2023",AFPONOVKTZQCDIHE5RWXZ7J5NQEQ,True,89,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R128VBKHE4O3F8,B0BXYCS74H,"3.0 out of 5 stars Too heavy, they get sweaty, even under normal temps, sound is OK but nothing to get excited about",Ty,3,"First, if I spend almost $350 on headphones, I expect a superb reproduction of my music. If voice/sound canceling was my goal, I could buy a $20 set to talk on the phone. I also tried the Bose and they too had great noise-canceling capabilities Again, that is not what most people buy high-end phones for. Maybe I'm old school, but I believe noise-canceling headphones are a new phenomenon, and the reproduction of sound quality is secondary. Honestly, I can't justify the price. Besides the discomfort, their heavy weight, and the excessive amount of sweat they produced, meant that every few moments I had to let my ears dry off due to the non-breathable plastic material of the cup covering the ear). After a while, they hurt. Sadly, I will be returning the Sony's and continue searching for a more refined musical reproduction. The accompanying software is not useful and really would not be needed for noise-canceling or if the phones produced a pure sound. One last thing: They just didn't give me the feel of pure joy and appreciation of enjoying music's separation of sound I don't mean stereo but rather ""Spatial"" without artificial tampering. If you've ever listened to music that has noticeable sound stage separation, you begin to appreciate the sound engineers who achieve that sweet spot. To be fair, music and how it sounds is an objective experience. I did not use them with a turntable. I bought a spare pair of inexpensive Sennheiser's for $30 with noise reduction. I have them on right now and while they're ok, you readily accept them because they're great for the price.

R1YW8QI0C833VS,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars The MX5s are not perfect but I am still happy with my purchase.,Alex,4,"The MX5s are not perfect but I am still happy with my purchase.I originally owned a pair of Bose 700 so my comparison is against them.BuildThe build of the MX5 is on par with the 700s. They have a matte finish which feels nice and grippy to the touch. The buttons have a nice feed back when pushing them. Compared to the 700s the feedback is night and day. For the 700s I would often think that I was hitting the button because it had such lite feedback with a squishy feel.The weight of the MX5 seems to be just a bit lighter than the 700s which I count as a positive because 700s relied more on the headband to carry the weight of the headphones versus clamping force against the ear cups. The MX5s have slightly lighter clamping force on the ear cups but not too little that they feel like they will fall off. They are a great balance of clamping force and weight that neither the headband nor the clamp force feel like they are carrying the full load. The lighter weight and balanced clamping force make them very nice to wear for long stretches while working. Compared to the 700s I would often start feeling fatigue on my head where the headband would sit because all the weight was supported across it.The ear cups are also a bit wider on the MX5 but a bit shallower when compared to the 700s. I have ears that stick out a bit more so with the 700s the extra room is welcome. The shallower MX5 do fatigue my ears after a while of wearing them but this was after a full day of wearing them.The headband adjustment is a bit sticky for my taste. It's a bit difficult to adjust the MX5s because the fulcrum point get the leverage to adjust them sits much higher along the headband compared to the 700s which I can easily adjust with one hand if needed. However, its the 700s would also lose the adjustment very easily compared to the MX5s when moving around because they rubbed against a headrest.Noise CancellingI won't focus on the sound quality because I am not an audiophile. However, the noise cancelling is fantastic. I would consider them to be a step above the 700s.Extra SettingsThe app gives you a ton of settings to play around with. The main things I find to be better than the 700s is that the MX5s bluetooth is much better. I live near a rather large radio antenna so interference with wireless signals is extremely high. Walking in the other room my 700s would start breaking and stuttering teh signal before disconnecting. The antenna for the MX5s must be better because I can go a bit give or take an additional 5-10 feet. Also when using connecting to 2 sources the switching is seemless. Once sounds stops on one device the second device starts playing right away. My 700s sometimes would refuse to switch and be stuck on one source until I would restart the device or manually disconnect one source.The app also lets you assign the noise cancellation double a triple tap actions to start a directly interact with a service like spotify. Actually only spotify. I wish the button customization would be opened up to other actions since I don't use spotify its a dead feature for me. The same button can also turn off/on noise cancelling but rather the headphones given a verbal sentence like ""Noise Cancelling 5"" to let me that I am in ambient sound mode. I need to learn the sound of 3 different tones. The 700s would do and I miss that feature and they would also let you customize the noise cancelling levels that you could cycle through. I'd like to be optimistic and say that sony can adjust these features later but they don't appear to be in the habit of adding features to the app. I also own a pair of the XM4s which are the in noise canceling headphones and I haven't notice anything new in the app since I got them.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2022",AFQGJAMQZAQF26CB2DVPM4VZVYEA,True,29,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R22XJZQKTNXP33,B0BXYCS74H,3.0 out of 5 stars Went back to my Bose 700s,Abby,3,"TL;DR: The sound is decent but not mind-blowing after you get the EQ dialed in. Before dialing in the EQ, they're very average and even a little muddy; definitely not worth $400 imho. They also creak ENDLESSLY while wearing glasses (not necessarily the fault of Sony but it did happen, it did annoy me, and I did return it for that reason). They sound very compatible to Bose 700s. If you choose to buy these, absolutely wait until they're $250 or less.About me: I am an amateur audiophile. I have 20 years experience being fussy about the sound that comes out of audio devices. It has to be at least good. I can't stand it when you're listening to something and it's muddy or obfuscated or doesn't give you the full sound because of inadequacies of the device. That being said, I don't know all the audio-related terms or specs and I am not an audio engineer.I read a ton of reviews and watched a ton of YouTube videos (especially from This is Tech Today) about these headphones. I am a longtime Bose fan, starting with the QC 15s, then the 35s, 35iis, and now the 700s. I used the 700s for almost 2 years before I started itching to know what else was out there. I came across This is Tech Today's multiple videos showcasing the sound of industry leading headphones, and I was horrified by how flat and awful the Bose sounded. Clearly I was missing out on a LOT.Price and feel----I bought these Sony XM5s at full price (long story, don't recommend it). My first impression after receiving them is that they certainly didn't feel like $400 headphones. MAYBE $200, but that's a tough maybe. The material is very light and eco-plasticky. They feel like that plastic that's designed to be biodegradable (I don't know if they are; that's just what it feels like). I was prepared for that based on others' reviews, so I didn't hold that against them initially.Comfort----When I first put them on, they were comfortable enough. After long wear sessions with my Bose 700s, I found the band to be a little uncomfortable on the very top of my head and I was worried these would be similar with the same form factor, but they're light enough that they are comfortable for long periods.Sound----At first, the sound was disappointing. Like all of you, I have certain songs I use to test sound from various devices and this was not giving me the full effect of these songs. I went to the internet for some EQ recommendations specific to the XM5s and this made a HUGE difference. They sounded pretty good.I no longer had my Bose 700s at this point (sold them to purchase these because I'm not made of money), but I used my partner's Bose QC35ii to test against. I didn't realize this until I went to test, but the Bose 35ii don't have an EQ setting in the Bose app. You get what you get. And what I got sounded VERY comparable to the EQ-adjusted XM5s. I spent a solid hour listening to the same test songs over and over with both, and while the Sonys come out just a little bit ahead, it's not a difference you're going to notice if you aren't directly comparing the two side by side. I wouldn't even miss it knowing about the difference if I had to use the QC35ii.Sony app----This app looks like it's from 2005. It's a little painful to use. I could learn to live with it, and it does what you need it to do, but it certainly isn't an easy or enjoyable app to use as of June 2023.The creaking----This is what did it for me. I wear glasses. I also wear headphones/a headset for 8 hours a day for work, and then another few hours for gaming in the evening. Without glasses, these creaked ever so slightly once in a great while. They're made of plastic so it's going to happen, and I could live with that. However, once I put on my glasses, the cushions against my frames creaked when I breathed. Or blinked. And if I turned my head, good lord the creaking. It was all I could hear, even while listening to music at inadvisably loud volumes.The verdict----I returned these and re-purchased the Bose 700s and I couldn't be happier.Again, I'm no audio engineer. I'm not claiming to be. But for me and my use cases, and my personal opinion on the value for money, I'm giving my money to Bose. I get more for less.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2023",AHF7JA3YLXY3XBZPWQ5JRAKZVQJA,True,60,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R39MN8FLS552NG,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Great quality but uncomfortable after an hour,User,4,"I've had this for almost a year now. The noise cancellation is okay. It isn't ground-breaking. You can still hear your surroundings if you concentrate.The sound quality is great. Now, is it great relative to its price? Probably not, if you're just an average, everyday person, which I am.Now, my biggest issue with these headphones is their comfort. The headphones feel lightweight yet high-quality. In the first hour, it's luxurious and comfortable. However, after an hour of use, the pressure on the top of my head as well as the sides of my head causes aching. I end up spending the next hour shifting the headphones forwards and backwards intermittently to avoid the aching on my skull.Only buy this if it is your dream to own these headphones.

R20WK709QH8M66,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely amazing.,Amazon Customer,5,"I used to own a pair of XM3s for quite a long time. I loved them so much. Bought them at about half the price than these. I wore those suckers out, accidentally broke them cause I'd use them to fall asleep and.. yeah, still worked but not the same. The price point on these XM5s is obviously super high if you know how numbers affect your bank account. I was kinda lucky because everyone I know for the past 3 years just gives me Amazon gift cards for special occasions (birthday, Christmas, etc) After literal years of browsing Amazon and not committing to using gift card money cause nothing sounded worth it, I finally purchased these. And still paid 150 dollars out of pocket. I have to say they are absolutely amazing. The noise cancelling is awesome (like incredibly good), the sound quality is... I pulled up a song on YouTube that I first heard 15 years ago (and still listen to it's not a memory lapse) and I swear I was hearing little details of the song I had never heard before. Comfy, awesome battery life, lightweight but doesn't feel cheap (better not).

R3T0GCTO01SV1U,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty Impressive! But Just a bit overpriced!,Anthony S.,4,For what it is there's a reason they're the best headphones you can buy in the market at this very moment!Durability: I will say the Durability doesn't feel good to the hand but I do believe these will be fine as long if you take care of them. But be very aware there is NO IP rating!!! If you plan to use these for workouts and are worried about your sweat or rain ruining these be cautious due to there not being an IP rating.Included Case: The included case is nice. Glad one came with it due to the of course wild price. Be aware though these headphones do NOT fold like the previous version. So yes the case is a little more bulk.Sound quality and Noise cancelling: The Sound quality is decent to pretty good. I will say I wish the equalizer was better with added channels to change. Despite sound quality being decent/pretty good the Noise cancelling is king on these! Sony has been Kong when it comes to noise cancelling and you WILL notice this with these.Features/Gimmicks: Now depending how you see these you may consider them to be Gimmicks or features. The Auto Adaptive sound control is pretty good. It will automatically adjust ambient noise depending what you're doing and it helps a bunch! Another feature or gimmick is speak to chat which can work but also not work. I've had times where I'm talking and it won't activate till after 5 seconds and sometimes 7 seconds. A point where time is crucial when speaking to someone you might as well take off the headphones or put your hand on the outer part of the headphones to instantly activate the ambient sound. So in terms of the speak to chat feature it can be seen more of a gimmick.Value for Money: This is the part where your wallet will cry and hurt. These are super expensive for headphones I must say! But In terms of Value for Money. It's at a crossroads of yes is it a good value but also not. But I will say this. You're better off getting these on a good discount. I got these on an early black Friday deal here on Amazon. But I found out on November 9th it was at a price of $255 using a price history extension for Google Chrome. So technically this deal they had on these for Black Friday was a really bad deal. So my compulsive buyer syndrome got the best of me. Overall all for price. Wait till these are $270 or less I would consider that a better deal!,"Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2023",AEQXWMMTSCAJRE3OJSTYSCCV3FTQ,True,7,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R16NN9RX85ZWB2,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Sound - but - Feels Cheap,Vinny9151,4,"Bought these to replace my aging Vmoda Crossfade II. Read a ton of reviews and decided to go for it. Out of the box, they sounded ok, but really came alive after messing around with EQ - using the Sony Connect app and/or a 3rd party EQ I've had for years. Very comfortable phones. Good sound imaging , great separation. Bass is punchy and tight after EQ changes; mids are fine and top end is pretty crisp and clear. There is a world of difference in sound between using my S22 Ultra and MacBook. Mac sound is pretty muddy and lacks presence. Using LiveOne on the S22 is 500% better; very clean and clear sonic attack. The Sony app is fine; lots (maybe too many) things to look at and think about. The thing I really don't like is how they feel when I handle them - very plastically - and honestly - kind of cheap feeling. Ear cup cover material seems low grade and a bit thin. And those ear cups - yucky feeling plastic. I would expect a better build quality (more solid feeling materials). Maybe the decision to go with plastic was a cost of design issue, in order tokeepp the price down and remain competitive. However, a product which sounds as good as these deserve better materials. Not sure if I'll keep them - need a few more days to make that decision. Bottom line: you gotta be your own judge, decide what trade offs you are willing to make to get the features you want and the that matter most. Also bought Boweres and Wilkins PX7 2Se. Will review them after trials.Update: I will be returning the Sony headphones. Although my comment about the plastic earcups still applies, I believe they would hold up as long as one was careful with them. Maybe the feel of the product is not important to you, but design and appearance count for me. Again the sound and features of the Sony is great.","Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AEUWXIXKO7NYKKERCPME7ITHKHBQ,True,1,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R31021WW6CLXL9,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Comparison to Bose NC700,mhans311,4,"I have used Bose NC700 for the past year, but saw these on sale for a great price and decided to try them. I had the XM4’s for a short time but had to return them because they were too creaky while wearing them. Luckily I have not had that same issue so far with the XM5’s. My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.ComfortThe XM5’s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s. This helps them go over the ears better. However, the NC700s have slightly thicker padding which makes the inside of the cup a little deeper. For this reason, I would say that the NC700s are a bit more comfortable for long periods. The XM5s are very comfortable, but after a couple of hours, I definitely start to feel them more than the NC700s. But both are great.Sound QualityThis is a matter of preference, but I prefer the deeper bass and fuller sound of the XM5s. I would say the NC700s have a more balanced sound, with far less low end. The XM5s really give a nice full bass, without it being over-bearing. I do prefer a bit more lower end than what the Bose provides. So for me, I prefer the sound quality of the XM5s quite a bit more than the NC700s.Call QualityI use my headphones for work calls several hours a day. Both the XM5 and the NC700 have great call quality and will work really well if you use them for phone calls or Zoom meetings a lot. I think I’d give the edge to the XM5s because they block out ambient noise slightly better than the NC700s, but the difference is negligible.Noise CancellationI mean, these are high end headphones and both do a great job with noise cancellation. I will say, I was surprised at how much noise the XM5s can block out. They block out voices and medium pitched noises better than the NC700s. They are both great with lower pitched things like plane noise. But I think the XM5s do a better job overall.Build Quality and DesignThis is where the Bose NC700s are just better than the XM5s. The build of the NC700s is just beautiful. They feel substantial without being too heavy, and there isn’t a seam anywhere. I also think they just look amazing. The XM5s do have seams around the ear cups and they feel much more plasticky. The XM5s are not bad, but they just are not as good as the NC700s as far as design and build quality.Battery LifeThe battery on the NC700 lasts me around 13 or 14 hours. The XM5s last around 25 hours. So it’s a pretty big difference. Charging speed seems about the same with both.Odds and EndsFeatures of each are similar. They both offer pass through audio and it works well on both. Touch controls work equally well on both. The case of the XM5s is a little bigger than the NC700s, if that matters to you. One small difference that may make a difference to some is that if you want to use the cord to plug them into a 3.5mm headphone jack, the end the plugs into the NC700s is 2.5mm. So if you lose the included cord, you will need a specific type of aux cord to replace it (2.5mm to 3.5mm). Whereas the XM5 uses a regular 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux cord.Overall I do like these Sonys better. I just wish they had the comfort and build quality of the Bose. But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, I’m going to be using the Sonys from now on.","Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2023",AETTXELYLNOYOKPRX647FKJQO2NA,True,128,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

RXP9X25616OKK,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Escape to silence and high quality sound,Thomas Volk,5,"I searched for the best of the best in noise cancellation, and these were consistently at the top of the lists. Short of putting some kind of physical sphere around your head lined with the foam they put into sound booths, I'd say this is it. It doesn't cut out everything, but I can't imagine a further reduction than these in the form of headphones.When you switch the noise cancellation on and off, you can hear the world again and see the difference. Someone can be standing right next to me talking, and it just doesn't get through. But a loud speaker nearby might still get a little through.Music sounds amazing through these headphones. These are the nicest headphones I have ever purchased, and listening to Spotify through these is like listening to the songs for the first times. I'm hearing delicate layers of sounds I didn't know were part of the song. The bass is rich but not forceful. I feel like I can hear everything in the song as it was meant to be heard while they created it in the studio.The only I miss from my prior cheapie headset was the physical volume adjustment knob right on the exterior of the headset. However, I'm usually listening to these on my cell phone or my Galaxy Tab A (like an iPad but Droid), and those DO have an external volume button themselves. So, it's only an inconvenience when hooking up Bluetooth to my Windows PC. In this case, I must have a little internal sound setting up on the screen to make it louder or softer, if the source content doesn't have a volume toggle like YouTube or a Streaming platform. Example is a game where the volume is set. Then I need the setting open.All in all, I'm extremely satisfied. They delivered on the best possible noise cancellation under normal circumstances. If you live next to someone using a jackhammer 8 feet outside your wall, perhaps you have bigger problems than these can solve! But the normal in-house noise, these should do the trick.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2024",AGMWATFS7EF7YD67666FGFMYVL3Q,True,0,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
RJAJFWZHN3W02,B0BXYCS74H,3.0 out of 5 stars Not worth the cost,M. Joy,3,"I read the reviews from those claiming professional audio experience with considerable respect and anticipation. I enjoy high quality music components - my taste has always been heavily rooted in 70’s Rock.As a drummer, and a serious music collector, I still enjoy the drive, spectrum, and talent that produces each part of the music - even though it is now rarely evident in today’s world of “noise”.I used a set of Bose QC35 headphones as my means of listening to music while mowing grass on my ZTR. These worked sufficiently while also giving an impressive rendering of music fidelity - all things being considered.After a few years I wanted to see if an upgraded setup was available - so the research, shopping, and review reading led me to buy these Sonys - despite that brand name not being one commonly associated with HQ headsets in the audiophile realm.Honestly - “overall” - It has been a disappointing decision made thus far. I get the feeling that the ANC is where the tech was implemented, not necessarily in the fidelity, styling, or sound drive.Other reviews adequately describe the somewhat cheap materials used. The lack of any manual buttons or controls on the set, coupled with the total lack of any printed manual is cheap IMO. Its case and packaging appear to be recycled - as a demonstration of Sony’s participation in the myth of climate change - so the tech stuff like “duo CPU and 8 mics” thing - gets a little drowned out.The folks at Bose use to piss everyone off in refusing to publish specs. They would reply “just give our speakers a listen”. And to a large extent - I think that applies here.These headphones do have a very good frequency spectrum , SNR, and although I have not thoroughly tested it yet - I’d bet the ANC works very well.The minimalist will love the flat black (or silver) shaved exterior. The one little paper included in the box (besides ads and the warranty) is a safety sheet that only lists ALL the MANY THINGS you should NOT do with them. Nothing is written inside to say how they can be used or enjoyed.You must download the “CONNECT” app, create an account, and use the phone app to set up and control the headphones. NOTHING is possible without doing that. (One more tether to tie you to your phone).Of course you read the terms and agreement when you open your account too - (and they wouldn’t dare use any of your PI, nor would your privacy ever be invaded).So I listened to the sound - and it is as good - perhaps a tiny bit better - than my Bose.But at a much higher cost - AND not until signing up & using the app to adjust the Sound. They are very lifeless without setting up the equalizer AND pushing the volume to FULL. This is a must.I’m not sure they even have the volume output of the Bose. That is a major concern to me due to my particular use - AND that I do like music to be fairly loud (and clear).Lastly, iPhone users - if you don’t play the game of getting the latest iOs revisions, certain functionality may not be provided. So iPhone users be sure to check on that.With such a price tag - and so many ties to endure - to gain and maintain full functionality with these, it may keep “fence sitters” like myself from returning them (after going through so much just to test them out).“Others” - who seem so thrilled - throwing 5 star reviews on everything they try, (and probably listening to compressed MP3 formats) will give Sony the goAhead on these. But I am not so thrilled. I like quality to be in all aspects of the equipment. And I like the USER to be in full control.There may be more to what Sony is getting here - than their customers.","Reviewed in the United States March 21, 2023",AEEZ24AWUXL2IA4UYFS6IUNU3PNQ,True,43,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

I own both the XM3 and XM4 models and I have come to really love both the sound quality and the extra features Sony has packed them. Fast bear on android is amazing, it works without any effort. The first time you turn it on or if you turn it on in pairing mode a picture of the headphones will pop up on a nearby android device and you just click connect, it is as simple as connecting air pods to an iPhone.Onto these headphones, they are exceptional. Battery life is amazing, but that is to be expected from any premium wireless over your headphones.The touch controls have a bit of a learning curve, but they are for the most part very good (I have one issue with them, but I will get to that later).The noise cancelling is amazing of course, but what is more impressive is the improvements made to transparency mode. It no longer picks up background noise from fans and cars as much as it used to. Support for Spotify tap means you can launch Spotify, and have it pick up where you left off without even touching your phone.The new safe listening feature tells you if you are listening to music at unsafe levels for too long. It keeps track of how much time you listen at various decibel levels so it can tell you if you have been listening too much.Sound quality is of course very good. Also, Sony's EQ is not the best, but for most people it is more than sufficient. If you like a bit more or less base you can adjust all of that very easily, and it comes with several presets.The issues:I have had three issues with my headphones so far. The first one was a strange bug where it identified to my phone as the FCC registered model number instead of as WH 1000 XM5 with a reset after a firmware update.The next issue is that I have not been able to get it to register with Google's find my device service, it is not a huge deal for me especially because I am less likely to leave the headphones somewhere that I am something smaller like earbuds, but it seems like that can be a bit hit or miss.The last issue is one that I alluded to earlier, and it is with the touch controls. These headphones do not have a physical Google assistant or any digital assistant button, instead you either say the wake word, or press and hold on the radio until you hear a tone. There is a strange bug when I tried to reply to a text that the Google assistant just read to me. It records my reply, but then says to push the Google assistant button to send or press and hold to record the message. You cannot push the Google assistant button, or you can do is press and hold which will just record the message so you cannot send your reply. However, this does not seem to be an issue when you just try to send a text, only when you reply so it is not the end of the world.Well, that ended up being longer than I thought it would. I hope someone has found this helpful because I just spent far too long writing it.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2022",AFAR5DY57O62LVBJOJ5WZYNM57XA,True,79,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R2G3A1TQELK0FJ,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Best Sound on the Market - Overly Sensitive Touch Panel Issue Common,BeanDaddy,4,"I LOVED my XM4s. I upgraded to the new XM5s to let a friend buy my XM4s. Sound quality seems about the same - still the best on the market that I've heard personally. However, I think the headphones themselves feel a little more fragile. The case also seems less sturdy, though it may just be a more efficient design. The only real complaint I have is the touch panel. It's very sensitive to hair, etc., and actually is triggered by simply moving my head or often nothing at all. It was really frustrated if it started clicking next and skipping through a queue of songs, so I turned off the touch controls entirely. I don't use them too much anyway and haven't missed them. BUT! Even though the touch control does not do anything now, it will still make the noise as if you are skipping a song. If only there were an update to stop that noise when the touch controls are off, I would be content with this workaround. PLEASE Sony, if you read this, just turn the touch noise off! I'm upset that $400 headphones have such a simple but significant design flaw which you can scour the internet to find discussions of, but as long as these headphones continue to offer superior sound quality, I would absolutely forgive and forget so long as I can turn the touch panel click off someday soon!","Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024",AEA73WEVKLQR4Y5IYHR65D7FVP4A,True,1,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

RD1KBOOEZR986,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Quality Headphones,Ryan,5,"I've had these headphones (which I bought refurbished off Amazon) for almost a year now and they're nothing short of phenomenal! Sony is really good at maintaining the application tied to the headphone user and the fact that I've recieved a number of helpful updates since buying these headphones has been great. I use these everyday for casual gaming, studying, and going to the gym. I recommend being cautious when using these when you're sweating a lot at the gym due to the sensors having an affect on sweat. I've noticed that the detection system build into the headphones doesn't necessarily work anymore due to how often I've sweated while wearing these headphones. One annoyance that I have is the ""Speak to Chat Feature"" which keeps turning on whenever I talk at the gym. It might just be my headphones in particular but even if I go into the app and manually select to turn this feature off, it some how keeps coming back and turns itself on again. This is frustrating when you're in the middle of a set while exercising and then all of asudden the headphones pause the music and ambient mode is turned on. Regardless, amazing headphones and I'd recommend them for anyone. I was hesitant to buy these initially due to everyone stating they do not hold up well in the gym but they still function well enough for my liking!In the second photo I posted, you can see the slight stain marks caused by usage in the gym. If you want to avoid this, getting the black colored headphones might be recommended. However, I have been able to clean these stains out with a cleaning wipe. Plus, these headphones don't leave finger prints on the headphones which I know first hand that the black ones do (which was annoying hence why I got the white ones).","Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2024",AETTEEK3UFST3ZTMT5PN3WPGY6DA,True,1,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R5OSWO113ZPKO,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars Noise Cancellation Awesomeness,Kristin,4,"Up front, I apparently have a super sensitive head. ALL headphones hurt after a while. These are the least painful and I can wear them much longer than others. They do cause pain after wearing extended amounts of time, but I find taking breaks lets me wear them most of the day. The noise cancellation, especially on planes, is sanity saving. I just went on a trip and spent 12 hours flying and in airports each direction. These were lifesavers. Plane noise, screaming babies, loud talkers, they handled them all with ease. Do I wish they would pack up smaller? Yes. Do I still think they’re worth taking? Absolutely. The battery life is so good, I never have to worry about babying them. For the annoying but not deal breaking stuff…they drop phone calls pretty regularly (but sound really good on calls). If you plan to use them for a lot of phone calls you may want to try something else, but if you’re like me and mostly listening to music…you’re golden.","Reviewed in the United States March 27, 2024",AGLO7OXRGKQFJPP27YS5F5JV232Q,True,2,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R2OA6TGYZGNBOZ,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Practically exactly what I wanted,Joshua,5,"The noise cancelation is really good. Like really good. But there are a couple complaints. They won't always block the same amount of noise, so if you live in a semi noisy environment, that really changes the way you look at these headphones. You can hear when the quality of this feature specifically, drops or rises. A really simple fix though, just turn the volume up a little more. Then it really is just you and the music. The transparency mode I felt just slightly let down. It can be better. Speak to chat is much more powerful which upsets me because it's like you don't even have headphones on. You end up wanting that kind of immersion on demand when it's only attainable through the speak/hold to chat features. Of course when those are enabled, the volume of your music gets reduced HEAVILY, so you can hear what's going on. If you're just turning on ambient noise, you might find it muddy or just not as clear as you'd expect or want. An amazing feature with ambient noise though, is you can control how much noise comes through. This helps me a lot because if you are feeling overwhelmed by your environment, you can just turn it down or shut it off completely. I guess you can say you have a lot of choices between complete isolation, and near perfect immersion. The pros, in my opinion, really overpower the cons. The sound quality is amazing. You can expect crisp, clear, quality audio with insane customization. The separation and sound staging are quite precise I'd say, and with the app you can have practically unlimited bass while still maintaining crisp, prominent highs, that do not interrupt or drown out the mids. Of course the amount of depth these headphones have can only make you dream of what more they may be capable of. I absolutely love the equalizer because now you have such a range with your listening experience, you can resonate with music on so many different levels using the equalizer. These headphones are built for every genre of music BECAUSE they're so precise and customizable as far as sound goes. That's a massive plus, interpreting a song differently because you changed the way it sounded. The smaller drivers do not in any way take from the sound quality. They sound like quality headphones, and the volume control is consistent. The sound quality does not change until about maybe 90-100%. They fit nice, but I wish the design were more like travel headphones where you fold the cups into themselves. They feel very durable, especially the headband. The touch sensors are nice too, but I wish you could use both cups instead of one, so you can customize what taps do what. Overall, they were worth the money. They're for everyone, however you listen, and whatever you listen to. Your preference in sound can be a lot more precise using these headphones. I mean, they really make it hard to say another pair is better. I have grown a lot with these headphones, musically speaking. There are no boundaries in the world of music, and there certainly are not limitations to reach that boundless world inside these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2022",AEOV73IEEBQE3D2CLMDT4LF5REYA,True,39,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R2Y56TA2GYJYDC,B0BXYCS74H,4.0 out of 5 stars It’s not 100% Noise Cancellation,Worm,4,"If you want 100% Noise Cancellation, use ear plugs that are made for it not a pair of Bluetooth Headphones. Does it work great if you’re playing music or something, yeah. Having Noise Cancellation with music playing does help focus more on the songs. I wouldn’t rate the “Surround Sound”/360 audio as mind blowing, but it does the job. That being said, it’s amazing how clear some sounds can be, such as in Call of Duty… or Minecraft. Zero disappointment if you want clear audio since the ear cushion works wonders (Not sure how long they will last though). As for charging and using the audio Jack at the same time since Bluetooth doesn’t work while it’s charging, I found it a horrible experience. Just get a good charging brick, a decent length usb-c cable and charge the thing once it reaches 20%. Go eat, take a walk or do it in your sleep but that battery wasn’t lying about being able to reach 30 hours. Though I would only limit it to 20-24 hours before checking the battery limit by pressing the power button again and hearing it tell you the power level. I don’t plan on killing the battery health and you should too for this price point. As for the range, Bluetooth 5 is impeccable especially with a quality device and limited walls between you, your pc and the kitchen. As for volume control, it changes it by small increment, though holding on to the right pad with your palm does activate transparency mode and lower the volume so you can hear someone talk. Downloading the app will show you a few things btw. It’s just a little overpriced by maybe $80 bucks, but you can’t deny the microphone quality. It’s quite good on mobile but if you use OBS to record there is always that noise. That being said, it does isolate my voice quite well in a loud environment and the Noise Cancellation keeps me from hearing anyone talk though to how high I have the volume playing my content to immerse myself. But like I said, without any content playing you can still hear stuff through the noise cancellation but once you play something else on top it’s gold. If there was once feature they should’ve added it would be dual control on both ear cuffs instead of just the right. I’m not left handed but it would increase usability since I don’t always get the action I want done though to me lying down or whatnot and my hand gesture was a little off from the four main directions. Also can we get a PC App or settings? I hate having to use my phone to change a few things such as the level of noise cancellation or shutting off/on the gesture control. There are times when I forget to turn them back on and when I switch to PC/Mac I have to go back to my phone to turn those controls back on. If there is a desktop App, me not so bright. That being said, it’s a good product, just a tad overpriced. Let’s see how long I can keep it alive.","Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2023",AFY2V4LYHK3EHFWUFTOKX7BMGDEQ,True,12,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

RLEMTFYFMDL31,B0BXYCS74H,"4.0 out of 5 stars Decent pair of headphones, but stay away if you need good sound quality.",Jacob A.,4,"For reference, used these for a couple of weeks before ultimately selling them. I found the ANC to be exemplary, and honestly the XM5's look amazing (in my opinion). Can't comment on the mic quality since I never used it, but I imagine it's quite good. Comfort was a bit of a mixed bag, it was in theory very good, but the narrow headband caused some discomfort after a while of listening! Now, onto the reasons I sold them: the sound quality is mediocre and said discomfort was annoying. Now, don't get me wrong: they would probably sound decent to most people. But upon unboxing them, setting them up, and spinning up Spotify, I felt my heart sink. The bass is very boomy and overemphasized, with little sense of control, and the vocals were garbled into oblivion. Overall the sound just felt incredibly unbalanced and unsophisticated, kind of like it was playing underwater. Now, obviously take it with a grain of salt: the sound is probably fine - it's not like it's unlistenable. I instead bought the Sennheiser's HD 560S and couldn't be happier. So TL;DR: Probably fine for most people. ANC is good, design is futuristic, comfort is decent. But if you really enjoy listening to music and appreciate it's beaty, you should definitely look somewhere else since the sound clearly wasn't tuned for and doesn't even come close to HiFi or audiophile level.","Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2024",AFUMFEXAJTNJ4FWRDQ6HUQPTYP3Q,True,31,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

I skipped the current software update this time, and they’re sounding great.Original:I’ve used them for a few weeks now. They’re extremely lightweight, actually too lightweight for my liking. When handling them, they don’t feel like the price that they cost. The sound is just alright to me. I like that I can customize the sound based on my own hearing in the app called Find Your Equalizer, which makes them sound much better. The soundcore headphones are cheaper headphones, but their app does this feature really well, better than Sony’s headphones app. The noise canceling was great for two days. Then the headphones updated to the latest software, and noise canceling has basically been nonexistent now. I’ve not received support for this issue. The automatic switching feature between noise canceling and ambient isn’t the best. The most annoying thing now is that there is currently a high pitched ringing in the left ear that goes in and out. Resetting the headphones did not fix the problem as it did for some users. Only solution is to return them for a refund since they can’t be replaced.","Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2024",AHDUS4MLOG7II2YS3SYNPRC2HCPQ,True,1,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

So I’m still on the fence.",Chuck1998,3,"Ok, I’ve had these for about 72 hours and as my title said, I’m still on the fence to whether or not I’m returning these.The PROS:*The ANC (active noise cancelling) is unparalleled in my opinion. Standing near my sink with the water running, and music at a very low volume, I couldn’t hear the faucet running. Like, at all. Even without any music playing, the ANC is amazing.*Great audio. I don’t know how it picked the song, but once connected to my phone it started playing the most chill and quiet slow beats of a song I’ve not listened to in a long time. I’ve never heard the song with such clarity. Flawless first audio impression.The CONS:*I gather that maybe they engineered these to be lightweight intentionally, as to not weigh down peoples heads for obvious reasons, but…I thought at least the circular part where the ear cup joins the bridge, would be metal, or metallic…but nope, plastic. It’s all plastic. And not just high density plastic, it’s that cheap low density plastic stuff. Like the cheap plastic you’d find in the cheapest toys section of a toy store. The entire thing feels…disposable. As if you get them for free when you board an airplane for a flight. After spending $400 on this, and opening the package, I INSTANTLY got a bad feeling it in the pit of my stomach, like I was ripped off by something on Alibaba, or Wish. These feel like disposable trash, folks. Which is the only thing making me contemplate whether or not to return these. I have a few weeks with Amazon prime to decide, so we’ll see. Like, usually with good tech you can feel the quality - either the specifications or the hardware. I can’t say that with these. They feel cheap. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯*This is a minor issue, but it irks me a bit. More of an FYI to you all. I have the black version. It’s matte black. Like that velvety smooth kind of matte black. Well, if you have oily skin, you might have a bad time. Unless you wash your hands obsessively before touching these…finger print magnets. Finger prints get everywhere. Instantly. I’d personally prefer smooth shiny plastic, as that coating will last longer (that matte coating WILL get scratched), and the shine of hard plastic wouldn’t show the finger prints everywhere. But anyways, that’s minor, and nowhere near as bad as the con of them feeling cheap.That’s pretty much it! They do an excellent job audio wise, but despite knowing that, I still feel like it’s throwing money away. The audio trounces my Air Pod Pro’s (and their ANC) by a mile, and I’ve not tried the Air Pod Max’s. But because they feel SO cheap, I feel like I’m getting ripped off. The case is nice tho, so they do lay flat - as you can see in people’s pics.I’ve not charged them yet, and I’ve used them loads…so I’m assuming their 30 hours battery life is legit.If you have Amazon Prime, go ahead and order them. You’ll have to gauge for yourself how you feel about the lightweight plastic’y feeling. If you don’t have prime, I’d hold off, try to find them in a mall or something to try out.It’s disappointing when you’ve been waiting for a model to come out for so long, and then you’re left…unfulfilled. I’m gonna keep the, for a spin for a few weeks, and we’ll see.

However is over priced.It has great sound, good noise cancellation and amazing battery life.The downsides:Extremely expensive (the performance does not justify the price).Noise cancellation: if you take the headset off for a seconds, the noise cancellation functions goes away... crazy setting! you need to switch off and on again. Very annoying.Volume control: Sony decided to play Star Wars and removed the volume at all! same with any other switch that previous headset had... so now you only have a power-on switch, that it is! and to pair and control the volume I have the following word for you: GOOD LUCK!The volume works with sliding you finger up or down. If you want to pause to tap twice. But hold on there, that you need to tap in the right spot, otherwise does not work (you might find yourself tapping your headset while walking, and it is hard to aim for the same spot!). The same with volume up and down. For some design reasons, the volume works in phases, so if you want to lower fully, you cannot, you are only able to lower bit by bit, repeating the action several times to get to the right volume. It is ridiculous. Takes a hell of a time and keep you busy with the device instead of enjoying your music/sound.The issue is very similar than the smart watches that has digital (virtual) control over functions, instead of having a wheel that you can operate with your fingers any time, including while wearing gloves. If you have your hand wet or you are on the move, it is basically impossible to operate the device. The mechanical wheel is the answer. The same with this headset: why the hell Sony removed the volume and pairing buttons? I wont buy the next generation of headset if they carry on this way.The device (headset) has been thought in a engineering environment, by engineers, not users. So it works precisely as the engineers defined, under the perfect conditions BUT life of the user is different. Try to volume up while entering a plane and having to carry your hand suitcase: impossible. Try to pair quickly with your rental car while on the go: impossible. The Sony headsets are a good piece of engineering but has huge challenges. My advise is to buy something alternative and not to spent so huge amount of money for a product that aim to re-invent the headset. Previous Sony headset did the job, was so hard to just improve on the comfort, the battery life and noise cancellation without the need of removing all switches in this new model?

R1ADKUSAWBANNE,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Surpassed expectations! Excellent for noisy apartments,Mike,5,"These headphones are a life saver! I live in a noisy apartment. My neighbors below me feel the need to blast their home theater stereos at all times of the day and night, and I wasn't expecting much from noise cancelling headphones considering how obnoxious the noise is, but on a whim I gave these a try.It's been a few days and I can confidently say that these Sony headphones work wonders! They are fairly lightweight, and they sit comfortably on my head for hours on end. The cups are soft enough so your ears don't feel squashed, and at the same time they do allow for decent breathability. This means my ears don't get hot after extended use, which was a common issue I had with headphones in the past. The headband is relatively comfortable as well; it doesn't dig into your skull once you figure out a good position for the headphones, though it might take a few tries to find that sweet spot.Sound-wise, again these headphones are top-notch. I'm no audiophile by any means, but they sound fantastic when listening to music or taking calls. The noise cancellation features work practically flawlessly. Even when my neighbors are making noise, the headphones cancel all of that out and reduce it at best to total silence, or (rarely) at worst, a very faint mumble. I noticed this tends to work even better when you have music playing, even at a low volume, in which case outside noise is completely negated. I also wear glasses so there is a small gap in the fabric of the cup which tends to let a tiny bit of noise in, but again it's barely noticeable especially when I'm listening to music.The volume controls on the cups are convenient especially when you're not by your computer or phone. Double tap on the cup to pause or resume audio, and swipe up/down to adjust volume. The microphone is fine; I haven't heard any complaints from others when I'm speaking during a call. Overall the connection quality to my computer is stable even with the unusual amount of Bluetooth interference in my apartment building.In short I highly recommend these headphones. They are a bit on the pricey side, however in my opinion it's money well spent if you're looking for some peace and quiet with a solid audio quality.","Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2023",AFT2KG66YHH4DCACIM3Q5D4AQWTA,True,44,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

Both headphones are extremely comfortable and ergonomic. I did like the way the Bose button/ volume control setup was done more than the Sonys but that wasn’t a big deal to me.

R21CPL9FEP376L,B0BXYCS74H,"5.0 out of 5 stars Harmonizing Comfort, Sound, and Technology in a Premium Package 🎧🌟👍",Chicago Dan,5,"TLDR: Sony WH-1000XM5 offers exceptional comfort and sound, efficient charging, yet it's an investment with slight fit issues. 🎧🔊💲I've explored various Sony products over the years, and my latest experience with the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones has been quite enlightening. Here's a distinct perspective on them:Pros:Unbeatable Comfort: They're surprisingly light and outperform other premium brands in comfort. The use of memory foam in the ear cups adds to the comfort, although it might need special attention over time.Rich Features: The noise-canceling technology is as effective as ever, and the ambient mode is a practical addition for situational awareness. The Speak-to-Pause Music feature is a clever touch for multitasking moments.Sound Quality Excellence: The audio clarity is impressive, especially for bass-heavy tracks, making them great for diverse music tastes and gaming on devices like the PS5. Note: they lack a built-in mic for gaming. Call clarity is significantly better than previous models.Rapid Charge Capability: The fast charging is a standout feature, offering quick readiness and a long battery life of 24-30 hours.Cons:Investment Cost: These headphones are a significant investment. If they fit within your budget, they're worth the cost for the quality you receive.Fit Quirks: While not a major issue, the fit around the neck can be slightly awkward for some users, especially when taking them off frequently. Unlike previous Sony models, they don't fold inward, which might be a minor inconvenience for storage and portability.Cushioning Considerations: The ear cushions, although comfortable, may compress differently based on usage, and might require eventual replacement.","Reviewed in the United States January 22, 2024",AEEMRVC4FH66OMPCCHMWCQTMARTQ,True,12,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R250958U8AFR0J,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars A very worthy investment!,Rachel,5,"These headphones may honestly be the best purchase I’ve ever made. I recently started a new job in a busy office building. I have very sensitive hearing, which means that I get distracted SO easily. I can’t focus at all whenever there is noise around me. So, I decided it was time to invest in some high quality comfortable headphones.I wear these headphones for about 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Believe me when I say that I have never once felt uncomfortable while wearing these. The material is soft and lightweight—perfect for all day use. The controls are intuitive, too. My favorite feature of the headphones is that they turn into a microphone whenever I’m talking to someone, which means that I don’t have to take off my headphones every time I want to have a conversation. I can also quickly let noise in (like an announcement from my manager) by placing my palm over my right ear. This has come in handy many times!The battery life is incredible, as is the sound quality. The noise cancellation technology is insanely good. I am seriously impressed by all of the amazing technology that is featured within these headphones.

R1WT4GPODTR9N9,B0BXYCS74H,3.0 out of 5 stars Feels Good but Disappointing,Shaun T,3,"This was an impulse purchase after hearing rave reviews about ""the most expensive headset I could get out there"" from a friend, (debunked btw). I truly expected more out of it only because I thought that a device covering my ears would offer a more complete and immersive experience, but... it really doesn't. The sound quality isn't as good as my old airpods, (probably because they sit in my ear canals), and that's more or less the standard expectation I had when I purchased these. They do sit comfortably and I do appreciate how light weight it is, (also the fact that my ears don't throb after placing a device over them), but it's still a bit lackluster. I will say, the noise cancellation does a good job as does the wireless feature which connects well to any device I'm using, (phone, laptop, etc.) If you have doubts about my review, make up your own mind on this one, this is just my experience.","Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2024",AHT24SHX2RJEMLM5XUOPLQAKPDQA,True,0,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

Don't think it's much better than cheaper headsets. So if you're looking for WOW amplified/boosted sound quality, this won't offer that.- Connection sometimes randomly drops when I take my headphones off my head (with the pause on remove functionality OFF).- The talk-to-pause music function is a neat idea, but sucks because it stops audio when I'm trying to talk to someone over discord or zoom -_-","Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2024",AHCEY64LOOPD65UCACROSGKI7DZA,True,1,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R1QNWLVDNCOEPI,B0BXYCS74H,3.0 out of 5 stars Decent headphones,Lance L.,3,"The overall build quality was great with the use of some high-quality plastic(or some other nice and light material) The new design didn't seem to impact functionality although it might help with the duration of the headphones by removing the hinges. However, to put the headphones back into the case, they had to be fully un-extended, which means every time I took it out I'd have to take some time to adjust the length again. Speaking of the case, the magnetic cable slot from the Bose headphones' case was nice and worked perfectly. The only complaint about the case is probably the zippers consistently get stuck near the two ends. To the core now, the sound is excellent as always with Sony headphones. Personally, I thought it was slightly dull/dark with default settings and wasn't massive improvement from the previous gen. The EQ in the app did help tremendously and clearly reflected the changes I made and it was able to tune to my sweet spot. To be fair, I'm no expert in audio so take this solely as an opinion base review.In terms of the ANC, Sony nailed it again and it blocked pretty much anything... Meanwhile, be cautious when you cross the street with these on although I was able to hear some car sounds from larger cars. The ambient sound was pretty similar to the previous(meaning it's good) but I'd say it's not as natural as the Airpods series(Airpods Pro I'm comparing to here since I'm too poor for Pro Max :).Up until this point, it probably seems like a 5 star review but the following would be my complaints. First of all, the quick attention mode is a great feature but it would only work on the right side of the headphone as almost all other features on this headphone. All touch controls are on the right earcup while the left just has 2 buttons for ANC/AMB and power plus the wire jack. It'd be nice if there was the option in the app to choose which side the touch controls are on or just make it work on both sides. This is not possible and understandable if there's never a panel to do touch control on the left but that's probably good thing to add for the future. Also, I'm aware that I could literally just flip the headphone(as they seem to be identical except for the buttons) and wear the Right on my left year, but why?Anyways, moving away from the left and right issues. Something minor would be that I'd personally like to customize my touch controls but that didn't seem to be an option in the app as I've looked in and out for it. Not to say that there are any controls missing but I'd prefer to customize it.Lastly, something about connecting to 2 devices simultaneously is that it works but not seamlessly. I'm thinking it's more of an issue with the devices that I'm using(iPhone and iPad) which don't work exactly like devices in the Apple ecosystem. For example, when I'm connected to my phone and playing music on it, the headphone doesn't change to iPad automatically when I start to play a video on the iPad. To make it change devices (I've tested it multiple times), I need to pause the audio on the current device in order automatically move to the other device. This is still easier than disconnecting and reconnecting devices but could be improved(maybe?).Perhaps some of these issue could be fixed by updates perhaps not. I'm giving this 3 stars mainly for the fact that the price increased and not all of the features are completely flawless. I don't think the price for an upgrade from the XM4's or other headphones in similar price range is worthy. Don't get me wrong, it's great and all, just not worthy as an upgrade.","Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2022",AH3X5TK4L57XIHVIRZ7HAJGCBHVA,True,9,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

R2MTCQRNNKYEXM,B0BXYCS74H,3.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect :(,Becca,3,"The sound quality of these headphones is incredible, and the noise-cancelling is absolutely stellar. I appreciate that there’s an option to let sounds pass through so I can hear my surroundings. Additionally, the app that goes with these headphones is pretty darn cool, and it’s nice to be able to change some of the settings from there. They connect to Bluetooth easily and quickly. They also look stylish—I love the color, shape, and matte texture of them, and the tap features are very convenient. The case they come in is also extremely nice.However, there are a couple problems.The most important problem:The cushion on top of the headphones flattened out after about two weeks of regular use. They’re very heavy, so without cushioning, they give me a headache shortly after putting them on.I could probably find a replacement cushion online, but it’s unfortunate to have to spend extra money to make them wearable since these were so expensive.The original cushion is so nicely attached, if I took it off to replace it I’d have to use a seam ripper. If I find a cushion that somehow slides over the original one, it won’t look as sleek and smooth.As a young person, this was my first time buying a very expensive item for my enjoyment, and it’s a massive bummer that it became literally painful to use after such a short time of having it.A much less important issue:It makes a little alert sound every time you tap on the left side of the headphones and there’s no way to change the volume of it. It can be annoying/surprising if you accidentally tap it, especially if you’re listening to something quiet.I can easily deal with an annoying tap sound, but not being able to wear them without headaches is a dealbreaker. I wouldn’t have bought them if I knew.They’re such high quality headphones in almost every other aspect, so it’s extremely disappointing that they’ve become so burdensome to wear.","Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2024",AEB3ZYZ7K27FLS4GLUKPCLX3TJVQ,True,1,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

Some people I read get a feedback noise when first putting them on but I don’t notice at all. I love the feature that detects your voice and turns off your music so you can have a conversation with someone. Also if you need to hear some you just put your hand up to one side of the headphone and it will also pause your music.

R3BP1X84ZCJS0R,B0BXYCS74H,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good, but I expected better",Scott Duckworth,3,"I upgraded to the XM5 after owning the XM2 for many years. I used the XM2 for 6 to 8 hours per day most workdays over the last 4-5 years, and I've done the same with the XM5 over the past 2 months. I also occasionally wear them while traveling by plane.The XM5 is good, but it let me down in four notable areas:* Noise cancelation for the wearer: Sometimes these things can't make up their mind about which noise cancelation profile to use. This results in a noticeable and distracting changes in the background noise that I hear. The issue has occurred when I'm sitting in an airplane seat in very mild to negligible turbulence, and also occurs when I'm sitting in a slightly bouncy chair. This happens whether or not Adaptive Sound Control is enabled. I don't mind if the noise cancelation profile occasionally changes and I can hear it, but this sometimes happens maybe 2-3 times per minute. Noise cancelation of the XM5 is maybe a bit better than the XM2, but at least the XM2 was consistent.* Noise cancelation of the microphone: This was the main selling point that convinced me to upgrade from the XM2, but since switching to the XM5 I've had more occasions where the person on the other end of a call couldn't hear me well and I had to revert to my phone or laptop microphone. I can't tell if this is just correlation or causation.* Battery life: It's good, but surprisingly no better than what I was getting with my XM2 with its 4+ year old well used LiPo battery. I typically go 2-3 full workdays without charging them, and will get low battery warnings around 4 days.* The material used on the earmuffs is squeaky when rubbing against my glasses. This is not a problem if I'm perfectly still, but just the slightest motion of my head causes the squeak. This didn't happen with the XM2.On the plus side, USB-C charging is nice (though that existed since the XM3), they are a bit more comfortable than the XM2, and being able to simultaneously pair to two devices is nice. To my ears, the music sound quality is about the same between the XM2 and the XM5.Overall, I wouldn't say that either the XM2 or the XM5 is better than the other, but I'm giving it 3 out of 5 because I expected that the XM5 would be better than the XM2. None of the issues are deal breakers for me, but all together they make the XM5 border between underwhelming and disappointing.","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2024",AH2X7RQUMWRPJKUKDSGMUUIRTUAQ,True,2,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

Considering the price you would think it would be mostly metal but in fact there really no metal on it at all. It feels pretty cheap. Now don't get me wrong The plastic is not creakily and crappy.

Otherwise it's very comfortable. Buttons feel pretty cheap though too The ones that aren't touch anyway.Overall I think for the price it could be mostly metal.

That said, I consider these to be good for these reasons:A: Exceptional battery life.B: Call quality that was considered good UNTIL I did a direct comparison to my Blueparrott B450-XT’s - NO WHERE NEAR the quality of the Blue 450’s, BUT the Blues are made specifically for calls in noisey environments. . Blues are in my opionion the defacto standard by which all other ANC phone calls should be judged. My ""demo"" for people is to run my upright vacuum cleaner whilst on a call. People on the other end cannot hear it AT ALL – REALLY!, I hear them, and they hear me perfectly! TRULY amazing! I did the same test with these and alas they failed miserably in comparison. I expected that. I was told they sound like I am in a room away from the microphone, a bit fishtank like, and muddy. SO, they’ll do in a call but not as a primary phone call device in noise. I heard a sample of the BOSE 700’s and they were terrible, which is what prompted me to get the Sony’s.C: One unconventional thing they do great at: A Sleep Aid. Yup, they drown out all the extraneous noises like people talking, Air conditioners, fans, Water coolers, hums, etc. ALL gone with nothing playing through them!I bought them primarily for playing on my PS5, and watching TV late at night. They do both quite well.D: Amazingly, my ears do not sweat much in these even after prolonged use. I’ve ordered those Dekoni Suede Earpads for them as well just for added comfort.(https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS4T3X62?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)(5/16/23 - Returned The earpads: they claim they are suede when in fact they are 2/3 suede. The inner part inside the cup is something else, not leather so NOT durable. Considering this, $49 seems FAR too expensive.)E: They are long-term comfortable unless you have ears like a B-52 in which case you will probably be stuffing bits.As for music, I find them to be more flat without pronounced highs or bass - which I prefer. The EQ on the app is a nice feature. The ANC works very well listening to music and will be adequate to the task in both quiet and noisey settings. Again, I remind you, I’m not 18. ;-)Pricewise, they ARE a bit expensive but the build quality seems better than most.If you have the time, I would HIGHLY recommend you test several brands and models at a store simply because sound quality is subjective and EVERYONE has their preference.UPDATE: 5/23/23 - Returning (REPLACING) Headphones - Why? They started acting ""Funky"". By that, I mean that if you turn them off, they will not turn on unless you do not hit any buttons for about 15 sec. NOT normal. ALSO, they started to exhibit Connection issues that were NOT there initially. I STILL, at this point consider them excelllent. Now, if the NEW pair goes weird, THEN I would have to re-evaluate.UPDATE 6-3-23: New pair are working as they should no connection issues or on/off bttun problems.UPDATE 2-16-24: Still working perfectly and I use them nearly every night to sleep.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2023",AFXILNJYGCIM3OBH4UNBTQTZVR2A,True,757,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones

They're actually some really nice looking headphones.Sound- these are absolutely incredible I'm hearing notes and backup singers and different nuances in music I didn't know existed and I've tried four or five different of the top line pairs including the JBLs, the boses, and the studio beats pro.These absolutey beat every other pair I tried and it wasn't even close. If I had to rate them in order these will be number one, The beats pro would come in at number two, The JBLs were number three and bose would be dead last.Comfort: I can wear these all day with no problem My ears will not be hurting the headphones themselves are very plush and comfortable and I have a smaller head in comparison to a lot of the headphones I've tried and the adjustment sizes are really great no matter what your head size is. The only downside is of how insulated I think the inner ear cuffs are because it will make your ear sweat after a while because it keeps your ears pretty toasty.And coming up on the number one reason why I bought these, these by far have the clearest sounding calls of all the headphones I've tried people on the other line can hear me clearly I can hear them clearly the Bluetooth syncs pretty effortlessly.Even the custom sound profiles that you can access during the app make it even better.The battery life is pretty good I can go pretty much 3 days 4 days without charging on one use I would have to say you probably can get a solid 24-30 hours runtime out of them.Literally the only thing that could be better on these is since they are made by Sony you would think they would hook up effortlessly to the PS5 and it does not which is really annoying considering it's the same company. You can still hook them up via audio jack into your controller and it works fine but I just think it's ridiculous that Sony will not let it be Bluetooth compatible to another Sony product like that.Overall even though it's pricey I think it's worth it and you're not going to do better than these headphones.Yes I actually own this product and I paid full price for them I am not a reviewer In fact I hardly ever come on here to review unless something's really great or something's really terrible.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AF5LHVZTV4NPWELGHZFV6XC3C4KA,True,22,Color: SilverSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R2NGQ3HUPCW8EU,B0BXYCS74H,"4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad, but I expected a little better if I'm honest.",kcd,4,"I'm a hobbyist musician and sound engineer of 20 years and also mild audiophile that builds my own speakers. I like to think I know a little bit about sound and what it takes to reproduce sound, but the tricky thing with headphones is that everybody's' ears are different. Like, they're physically slightly different which makes every single person hear the exact same sound slightly different, but there's also our individual listening preferences too, so keep that in mind as you read this review. Personally, I prefer smooth, balanced, and LOW bass (down to 20Hz), but NOT boomy bass. I also like some sparkle in the highs (8k+).Initial impressions upon arrival and setup:- The packaging looks like it's a cheap recycled cardboard of some sort. Obviously doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- The zipable case the headphones live in also seem kinda cheap and flimsy. Again, it doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- Accessories are fairly light as it only comes with a stubby little 8"" long (seriously) USB charging cable (not even a wall adapter, just USB A to USB C) and a generic 1/8"" stereo headphone cable if you want to physically plug them into a headphone jack.- The app was easy to download, install, and update. It did require making a Sony account though, so points off for that.- Pairing the headphones to my phone and also my computer was quick and seamless. I did have to restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source. For example, the EQ curve I set on my phone was not active when I then paired the headphones to my laptop and listened to the same track.- Really needs more than 6 EQ points. Sony, you can do better than just 5 predefined sliders and a bass slider (basically 6 sliders, so IDK why the bass is separate from the rest).Listening impressions:- Best sounding headset I've purchased to date and sound MILES better than my Sennheiser HD 596 (but to be fair, those sounded ridiculously unnatural and just all-around terrible).- Plenty of ""thump"" by default, but definitely dropping off significantly below 50Hz or so, which is exactly what I like to have present in my mix. You can see I've put a HUGE boost in the low lows on my EQ curve to make things like low synths, bass drops, and sub-harmonics sound even with the rest of the sound stage. Even still, the sub-bass that is there still sounds a bit thin and artificial like they're using some processing trickery to make it sound like it's playing lower than it is (there are a few ways to do this, but they're never as authentic as just reproducing the frequency properly).- Little bit ""dark"" sounding, so a slight bump in the high mids as well as a 10k+ shelf bump really helped brighten up the sound stage.- Imaging is ok but definitely not spectacular. It's only got a single 30mm driver per ear, so that one driver is covering EVERYTHING from 20Hz to 40kHz. As such, it's expected that imaging won't be super detailed, so no surprise there. I was really hoping to see at least 2 drivers per ear. By contrast, my CCA C12 in-ear-monitors (IEM's) that I use when playing on stage are about $50 and have 6 drivers PER EAR each playing a different frequency range. Needless to say, the imaging, and extension on those IEM's is a LOT better than these headphones that cost 7x the price. Due to their small form factor, IEM's can use armature drivers where 'can' style headphones like this can't use armature drivers (not loud enough), but I would still like to see 2 dynamic drivers in these just to allow one driver to focus on the highs and the other to focus on the lows rather than having the one driver trying to play the whole shebang.- Minimal, but still present, ""pressure"" sensation when noise cancelling is on, but it's not intrusive like a lot of other ANC headphones I've tried and effectively disappears when music is playing. Having a set of ANC headphones with ""pressure"" that grabs my attention is an absolute deal-breaker for me regardless of price point.Overall, these are going to be my go-to headphone for the office. They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2023",AGWUCS3NKCOOQFWGTSA3JKVOMBOA,True,255,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R1JS47AJOJKY1K,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Overall the XM5 are the best,Scooley,5,"For some reason I’m obsessed with headphones so here is the most straight forward review to help you out.Price - They are all expensive, usually in headphones you pay for what you get.Sound - APM sound better, but you’re not gonna know unless you compare them side by side. XM5 sound amazing.Comfort - Super light and really comfortable. Headband doesn’t bother me at all. Trick is to expand the headband so it doesn’t rest on the top of your head that much. APM are too heavy, Bose feel slightly better than XM5.Features - They are the best you can get.Controls - Amazing, touch controls work great!ANC and Transparency - ANC is really good and on par or better than all other brands. Transparency on APM sound like you’re not wearing headphones, XM5’s transparency is much better than XM4 but do sound electronic, like you can tell it’s coming through the mic. It’s no APM but 2nd best for sure.Build Quality and Design - Plastic but that’s a good thing because they are lightweight. IMO they look better than anything else.Multipoint Connection - Set it up in the app and you are good to go with 2 devices. Stop playing on one device start playing on another. It’s seamless for the most part but sometimes you may have to reload the video or song to get it to play.Headphones are really subjective to the user. What I’ve learned is sound quality and comfort matter more than anything. There aren’t any headphones that are perfect and check all the boxes but the XM5 IMO are the best on the market.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AHRRPRN7Y4X3UP2Z3YN6EWQJCUVQ,True,24,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R36XGSDG52PX3E,B0BXYCS74H,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony never disappoints!,Richard Huynh,5,"I thoroughly enjoy what Sony has to offer in their product line. I have the PlayStation 5, a Sony Bravia 4K TV and several other Sony products. Yes although I have owned a few of their product line I will not try to be biased here with the review. What got me into Sony products was really their earphones dating back to 2011! They have the best earphones you could get for $20 back at the time in 2011 and now the quality they still continue to put out never disappoints! Here's the pros and cons of the Sony WH-1000XM5.Update: I also picked up the XM4 Earbuds from Sony and take note that those are on a different level for listening to music compared to the XM5 Over the Ear headphones. Shares the same features like the XM5, not the same sound like over the ear obviously but also more marketed to those who goes to the gym and likes something more compact.Pros:Comfortable and lightweight!I don't ever have a complaint with what they have to offer when it comes to comfort. These are better than BOSE in regards as to comfort. I think the one thing that makes them comfortable also is that they are light. They weigh only about 0.56 pounds! People tend to have problems with headphones if they are heavy in my opinion! I also assume they use a low density memory foam for cushioning which is great but will eventually need to be replaced or tended to if left compressed or squished for too long.Unique featuresNoise Cancelling is top notch but not much different than their previous lines in my opinion! It is a standard these days to get noise cancelling and the headphones are great for drowning out noise if need be. They also tend to those who need to be aware of their surroundings by implementing a ambient mode like previous models. Works great and works like a charm by either taking the headphones off or covering the touch control panel. Also the Speak to Pause Music feature is insanely nice to have! Helps when your hands are busy and or you just don't want to adjust your headphones having to speak.Superb sound!The sound quality out of these are amazing! Does really well in all areas of music genres. Particularly really in low frequencies for bass! I get to enjoy these at a great volume and it pairs amazingly with my PS5 as a gaming headset! (Will mention the headphones does not come with a microphone for gaming when using a headphone jack.) As a pair of noise cancelling headphones, you can expect to hear a positively good detail in music, movies, gaming or even a phone call! They are clear and surprisingly really balanced. The microphone on these headphones for phone calls are great. Better than the previous versions.Fast charging!The charging rate of these headphones is incredible! I never knew how fast charging can be with this! There's times I have left this powered on overnight as I'm at work for my 10 hour job and it was drained by the time I wanted to use it again. In those times I left it charging and goodness greatness these were ready to go in a about 10-15 minutes! I enjoy these so much that I'm actually glad they have a 24-30 hour battery life.Cons:Cost.Its expensive! If you can get these on sale, it's worthwhile! If it's in your budget go for it! You pay for what you get in my opinion and these are worth their weight in gold!Fitment.They don't exactly fit around my short wide neck whenever I need to take it off and be present in a conversation or in my surroundings. Not exactly a big matter or deal breaker. More so it's a personal perspective. My neck size is 15 ¾ inches in circumference and that's pretty average I believe. I have to extend these in order to keep them around my neck without compromise. They also do not fold inward like the previous Sony headphone models but again never a issue.Cushion. Yes the ear cup cushions are comfortable but again when I place them around my neck it compresses the cushion to a point where it feels awkward after putting it back on. I'm looking at other options to replace their soft fit leather design.Update: There is different earcups that you can replace the OEM cups with but it comes at a cost of I believe $60 which is worth noting.Conclusion.Worthiness of $350+ (price as of 12/07/2022) during the holidays? Yes!Personal opinionated review:Sony WH-1000XM5 or other leading competition? Sony, easily Sony. I've never been unhappy about this purchase and I tell people that Sony is industrial leading company that continues to impress people when it comes to their headphones. Beats by Dre(Apple), Apple and Bose has always been great by popularity but Sony gets appraised by quality!I will update this review as I go until they put a new model out.","Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2022",AG4AFQ2RC6MGWY2PL7QUCONDWZOA,True,220,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R22JP1IN84JKFS,B0BXYCS74H,3.0 out of 5 stars Volume Controls Are Very Problematic,Bill Doerr,3,"I bought this in late 2023 as he Sony brand has always held a bit of panache for me (and, others). So it was a no-brainer.Prior to buying these headphones, I had used and loved my Jabra headphones which I still use and still love. Sadly, while the Jabra's sound and ease-of-use was superb, the ear cushions did brcke down too"" And so I through, ""WTH . . . let's see what the Sony headphones are like.""What these do very well: 1. Sound quality I'm sure there are better headphones out there, but these are pretty danged good quality 2. Comfort Sony did well here. I use them for making / taking calls and I can leave them on all day without a problem. 3. Battery Life Again, these last me a whole day -- making and taking calls and listening to music, radios and TVWhat these do NOT do well: 1. External controls Simply unacceptable when you need to change the volume from the headphones quickly and easily. I own a different brand of headphones (Jabra) that uses a 'mechanical' button to easily adjust volume -- the Sony headphones require running your finger/s over the headphone's surface to make changes. This functionality rarely works. And, when you need to adjust the volume, it's extremely frustrating to do so using the headphones. 2. Noise Cancelation Again, a key frustration for me. When I use it, a different tone follows each setting. My Jabra uses actual voices vs. tones. For example, my Jabra says, ""Noise-cancelation OFF"" -- the Sony just emits a tone/ And, because the directions are so bad, you can't find out what each tone suggests. Also, the N/C functionality it far less effective at killing ambient noise than I find I get from my other headphones. 3. Software Sony's software is far more complex than is actually needed to what it's designed to do -- LISTEN to good music, take calls, etc. Even though Sony's manual allegedly explains how to use the software, due to its complexity of it, most won't use nearly half of what it could do for you. Again, a missed opportunity here, as well.QUESTION: I'm often asked, ""Would I buy the Sony over the Jabra if I had to buy another set?"" Candidly, ""No, I wouldn't. Why do you ask?"" Both are good brands and the sound quality and ability to take / make calls are good (Though Jabra is better). But the horrific (IMHO) volume controls the Sony has as well as the noise-cancellation argue Sony made something good . .. good and complex. Still, the SONY headphones are good but they still need to refining them so they work as you'd expect.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AF5RNDUYL3MDYR7SFLIJH6MDOLDQ,True,1,Color: Midnight BlueSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R1Z5IQRHE12YL4,B0BXYCS74H,"5.0 out of 5 stars UNBELIEVABLE carbon fiber sound quality, improved ANC with 2 processors and 8 improved mics",Fresh and Felicia,5,"The media could not be loaded. I own Sony’s WH-1000 XM4s and the Bose 700s, two of the leading models in the industry. I had AirPods Max for a minute, but I rage-sold them. To me, the Sony and Bose are both awesome headsets. So I was psyched to hear Sony was releasing XM5s. Summer’s here, and these can get a little hot on hot days outdoors. It’s like wearing earmuffs on the beach. But, if you can get past a little sweaty ears, or if you use them indoors or on airplanes, you should be a little excited.The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones feature, what Sony advertises, “industry-leading noise cancellation.” And they ain’t lyin. With Bluetooth 5.2 and Sony's QN1 and V1 chips, the XM5s have DUAL processors - compared to the lonely single processor of the XM4. These two processors control 8 microphones for crazy accurate noise cancellation. Think - a little computer actually sampling noise from fans, airplane engines, air conditioners, motors, and consistent noise like that - and creates an identical but perfect opposite wave, so they kinda cancel each other out. And this time, the dual processors are capable of filtering higher frequency sounds, including some voices. It’s pretty cool tech. The first time you hear this, it’s like magic! In my video review, you can see my personal reaction.With the XM5s, noise canceling is automatically optimized based on your wearing conditions and environment. You don’t have to do anything. It knows if you’re sitting, walking, in an airplane, et cetera.No, noise reduction probably won’t completely cancel a very loud angry spouse, or a crying baby. But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s. I’ve never experienced this personally, but be aware it could happen. You can disable it if you need to. Some people thought the WH-1000XM4s were too snug. I thought they felt great, but they’ve improved the fit with a new lightweight design with soft-fit leather. This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you don’t want to hear.There were a few other design changes – the XM5s aren’t foldable like the XM4s, and there’s a redesigned case that’s collapsible to save room in your bag when you’re wearing your headphones.With up to 30 hours of battery life, you’ll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Musk’s rockets. But, in case you forgot to charge and you’re in a hurry, you can get 3 hours' worth of charge after just 3 minutes with an optional AC adapter.And unfortunately, the in-flight plug adapter is not included in the supplied accessories this time. But who uses that anyway? That’s so old school! Fortunately, there still is an aux-in for you old-school holdouts.The touch controls survived, where you can pause/play/skip tracks, control volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer phone calls. And the speak to chat lives also, where as soon as you start a conversation, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops your music and lets in ambient sound. And wear detection knows when you take them off.But – how do they sound?Sony has popped new, more rigid, 30mm carbon fiber drivers in the XM5s. They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced sound, better clarity, and more accurate bass. That’s important if you listen to real music, you know, with actual instruments, like rock, jazz, r and b, country, classical, and music like that. The XM4s have 40mm drivers, which will probably be better for hip-hop. The XM5s will reproduce hip-hop very accurately, meaning the way the studio producer intended you to hear it, but they probably won’t have the head-vibrating tinnitus-inducing bass many people want. TBH that's hard to find in any headphone due to physics.The XM5s support LDAC and spatial 3D audio, whatever that is, and they have also upgraded their Sony Music Studios Edge-AI music algorithm, which somehow magically guesses what musical dynamics were lost during compression and tries to replace that, so everything sounds crisp and clean without losing the bass that’s necessary in most of today’s popular music.I have heard some folks claimed the MX4s sounded “muddy” with some music. I didn’t notice that, but I’m a producer and I’m familiar with equalization. There are about 20 presets including several you can create yourself.And even without the Qualcomm APTX Low Latency chip, both my XM4s and XM5s allowed me to watch a complete movie on Netflix on my 2022 Samsung Frame television, wirelessly, from 10-plus feet away, with ZERO loss in mouth synchronization. Plus, like my XM4s, the XM5s still have dual Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices at the same time and switch back and forth between them. It's a pretty cool feature if you use them for your phone, but also want to use them to watch YouTube videos at work on your computer. But, you probably shouldn’t tell your boss about that.And the XM5s work with Google Assist, Alexa, and Siri. You can even set up Spotify playback with a few taps. Try that on your Air Pods Max.The big win seems to be a vast improvement in the sound of your voice during phone calls quality. They’re actually impressive when it comes to calling in louder rooms. I’ve made test calls on busy streets and on windy sidewalks, and my call-ee said she couldn’t tell I was actually outdoors. Apparently, the four beam-forming microphones and the dual-processor software can recognize your voice and somehow block a lot of background noise. I mean, you can still probably hear tire screeches, gunshots, and car alarms, things you’ll typically hear in the city. But a lot of the noise is just gone. Like magic!Oh – and there’s Speak to Chat. You start speaking, and the XM5s automatically adjust noise cancellation to pick up the voices of other people. No buttons, no fumbling with your phone. That’s a pretty cool feature.So are they worth the upgrade? If you have XM4s and you think your call quality is shaky, then grab some XM5s and sell your sweaty old XM4s on Craigslist. If you’re moving from Bose's Noise Canceling 700 or QuietComfort 45s, the new dual processors and 8 microphone array will provide some noticeable improvements, plus the dual Bluetooth sync, so they’re probably worth looking into. If you’re done with your Air Pods Max and prefer better compatibility with non-Apple stuff including android phones, PCs, and Sony or Samsung Smart TVs, it’s a no-brainer.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2022",AFWWNMFZLULQLTUU7IM6PHHRLEFA,True,1392,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R21NMC3L9AHPU2,B0BXYCS74H,"5.0 out of 5 stars Improvement over the Sony XM4 with ANC and sound quality. ""OK"" for office use (read)",W. Kwok,5,"I was hesitant about purchasing these because I was mostly satisfied with my Sony XM4 headset but was looking for an upgrade/replacement because the XM4s just get buggy with resuming my music sometimes when I put my hand over the earset or accidentally speak while listening to my music. I also was using the XM4 at work in a noisy environment where web conference participants would complain about the background noise from its mic.I purchased the XM5 to replace the XM4 at work primarily to address the noisy background complaints. The ANC on the XM5 was noticeably superior to the XM4. In online meetings, the same people who complained about the background noise when I spoke remarked that they could hear my voice much better with my new (XM5) headset. However, if I didn't speak and there was some loud noise, they would still hear it, but it was welcome feedback that when I did speak, the microphone minimized the background noise and my voice carried over better in my meetings. Since this was my personal consumer headset, my company eventually went to a commercial solution and got the EPOS 5000 series headsets, which have far superior directional microphones that put the Sony XM5 mic to shame. Hopefully, that bit of information is helpful if you are challenged by noisy environments like a call center where you're next to another person.Back to my XM5 review. I'm giving these a 5 star rating because for a consumer-level product, they are well worth the price I got them for(about 300 on sale). I used them on a flight and was in pure bliss being able to focus on my movie and music without having to compete with the airplane engine drone. For bluetooth headphones, they sound pretty good, but will never exceed a quality set of wired cans that cost more. You can adjust the EQ settings to make the Sonys sound better. I have since gifted this headset to my wife, who loved the ANC and how much clearer it made for her to be able to listen to hear tunes or watch movies. I'm looking forward to Sony's next iteration of the XM series headset. I got excited when the ULT model was released, but that's just a middle range model that still won't surpass the quality and performance of the XM5s. The battery life on the XM5 really does last about 30 hours too, so you'll easily get one to two days of full use on one charge. Below is a summary of some things I really liked and/or disliked about the XM5:PROS+Portable zipper carrying case included with accessories (3.5mm gold plated headphone cable, USB C charge cord)+quick pairing+adjustable EQ+rivals or beats other similarly priced ANC BT headsets (Bose, Sennheiser, Apple)+normal phone calls sound great+30 hour battery life+quick charging (3 hours after 3 minutes charging with special optional AC adapter)+Alexa and OK Google compatible+touch controls on the headset+improved sound quality over XM4+design seems more durable than XM4+instant pause and replay when taking headphones off and putting them back on+Amazing ANC (automatic noise cancellation) that you can turn on or off with a switch+collapsible design where headphone earcups fold flatCONS-Bluetooth 5.2 is starting to age since 5.4 improvements are available in other headsets-Not as compact when ""folded"" as the XM4s were-Just adequate for noisy environments (get a commercial headset for call center level noise)-Not water resistant, so avoid the rain or sweaty workouts-Incremental upgrade over XM4, even though it's noticeable-Two prong airplane adapter is omitted from the packaging (they're included in the XM4 packaging)","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024",AE57LA6R33NROCKCODXW5Y5ABQPA,True,12,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones
R35KI88KVX6G6L,B0CCZ1L489,3.0 out of 5 stars Consistent durability issues,Joshua B. Dailey,3,"For $400 cans, I expect better durability. I got these late November, 2023. In March, 2024, the earcup's stitching started to become frayed, allowing the inner foam to contact your head. This impacted the efficacy of the noise cancelling as more sound was now able to leak through the foam rather than the leatherish material forming a seal and blocking noise. I live with a loud housemate, and near an Air Force Base so there are jets running at all waking hours so the noise cancelling is very important to me. This issue also impacts their comfort.In April, I made a claim to Bose asking for replacement ear cushions as it should still be under warranty. Instead, they asked me to ship my set to them and they would send me another with a refreshed warranty. All-in-all a good experience, they stand behind their warranty. Now it's July and it's all happening again, on both ears (was only left side before). So do I have to send them in for warranty replacement every 3-4 months? They do offer just the earcups on the Bose website for $35 but the set is only 3 months old. I shouldn't have to spend $35 more every 3-4 months to use the headphones I already spent $400 on.I'm not much of an audiophile but I do very much enjoy the audio quality these put out. Immersive Audio is pretty cool too. The range on them is very good around most of my home. The battery life is sufficient, only ever a problem if I don't charge them daily which isn't as bad as it sounds. The clamping force is just right, maybe could be a tad tighter. They sometimes have this software glitch where they are stuck on and won't power off so you have to plug them in to charge so they shut themselves off that way. This is annoying but not frequent.The auto shutoff feature is very annoying since it is tuned to be so short. I'll take them off to go to the bathroom and they are off by the time I get back. Bootup is pretty quick when that does happen. I have auto shutoff turned off in the app but it doesn't matter, they do it anyway.The immersion mode and ANC are both the best I've ever experienced. Much better than my WH1000XM4's I came from.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",AGNJBJLV6ES6V7MXRJOTVLG65HLA,True,0,Color: Black

Band made out of aluminum even with hinge so that's solid.Cons:These headphones can tend to become a fingerprint magnet especially on the bose logo, a solution would be to buy a cover or get a vinal sticker to cover them to your liking.And you can't seem to turn off the anc, only way I seemed to was to make a custom profile and turn the anc all the way down. About the app, the immersion mode is a little lack luster to what I was expecting, makes the headphones sound like a speaker system around you in a hollow room? (Would like a way to change that echoing and such)All in all?These are a premium headset and a lot of these issues can be fixed through the apps settings like the wake on lift ect, turning that off will make the pair turn on faster through the power button, I do miss the switch for power, but to give an automatic power on and off so I can be less worried about forgetting to turn them off is such a nice feature vs you forget to turn off the qc 35 off and now they are 25% in the morning, more or less these are for people who want the best of the best from bose, any issues I've seen from the 1 stars seem to be a user error as these cans will sound as good as they can with a capable phone, don't bother pairing these with a old phone that doesn't supoort adpt x or ACC and expect the best sounding experience.","Reviewed in the United States May 3, 2024",AGF4LKTHI73ZXZ32JMENWS75CLQA,True,23,Color: Sandstone

Maybe people consider these as a mid-range headphone but you can't beat the sound quality and comfort.If you do your Research on YouTube or other sources, you will notice Bose are ignored.I rather think this is because of Bose success in the audio industry for over 60 years.More recently companies have been trying to copy Bose success with a plethora of advertisements and sponsored reviews. I tried Competitors and shocked by the poor quality even Tho reviews touted how great they were. I did my research thoroughly and fell into the trap of suggestions such as Audio-Technica and others touted as the best.

R30RY1LCLTMU71,B0CCZ1L489,4.0 out of 5 stars Not ready for prime time!,Matt,4,"EDIT (1/8/2024): I discovered a workaround that is partially effective. In the Bose Music app, on the Modes tab, hit the + button to add a new mode. On this tab, you can access a Noise Cancellation level slider with 10 levels. Putting the slider about half way allows enough ambient sound to come through that you can hear yourself speak while still reducing distractions around you. It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Number one thing you need to know: If you're using these for meetings or phone calls, wait. Right now, there is a bug where you cannot hear yourself speak (i.e. self voice / side tone doesn't work). It's as if you're conducting a meeting with ear plugs in. This is Bose firmware 1.5.4 (for those of you reading this in the future).I've tried this on two different headsets, one from Amazon, one from Walmart, different manufacturing dates. It flat out doesn't work - there is no difference between high self voice and off. I've also updated the Bose Music app - doesn't help. The good news is that this is probably a software bug as aware mode seems to work (can hear myself speak but also hear everything else in the room as well).Bottom line - I think this headset is nice, but I'm not sure about it being worth $420, and definitely not worth that amount when I have to switch to my older QC35s to conduct Teams meetings so I can hear myself speak.Also not a fan of the solid state volume slider. I much prefer the buttons on the QC35 series.Edit: On the Pro side: one not advertised feature is bluetooth range. This headset supports bluetooth 5.3 which is a significant upgrade from 4.x that the QC 35ii supports. With this headset, I can leave my phone in one corner of the house and walk all the way over to the other corner with no loss of signal. It's more than double the range of the older bluetooth protocols. The headset is backwards compatible with bluetooth 4 devices, but to get this benefit, make sure your phone / laptop / whatever supports bluetooth 5.On the negative side, another feature that annoys me on this set of headphones is the on-head detection. The way it's supposed to work is that when you take off your headphones, they automatically pause whatever is playing and go into a low power state. In theory...In practice, this is somewhat annoying for two reasons:1. It's not bullet proof. Maybe 1 out of 20 times I take off the headphones, it doesn't detect it and the music keeps playing. The benign case is when music is playing and you notice it and fix it. The treacherous case is when you've already paused the music, take off the headset, and then it doesn't go low power mode. Next time you wear them the battery will be dead. 2. If you take off the headphones, they don't disconnect from Bluetooth right away. It takes some time before it disconnects. So you end up having to manually disconnect anyway to use your phone / laptop speakers instead of the headset, and at that point you wonder why these don't simply have a slider on / off switch like the older models.","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2023",AHCZVQCWBAMXLKKZQXHPNKGS4YNA,True,37,Color: Black

The microphone is atrocious. I went and spent another 100 bucks on getting a really good ml standing microphone for my pc. Now into why I traded these so highly. The sound quality is good enough that your songs sound different. They sound so much better. Not to say audiophile grade, but certainly a cut above my astro a40s from before. (tho it's 3 generations old by now) and instead of the ASTRO a50s (Bluetooth variant as opposed to the corded I use to run) I chose these. They're great. Multiple profiles to control the sound canceling (which is blissful quiet on my bus rides) and great app support that can add custom profiles that adjust anc and tge gain, boos, eq and so many more small fidly bits. Also great. There is one more gripe, however it's more personal. The long press isn't touch receptive, it's distance.

Don't get me wrong, the Bose are excellent headphones. They sound great, but their volume is very low. The Sony's have higher volume. They're bass is not as good as the Sony's. The microphone on the Bose for making phone calls is horrible. The Sony XM5 microphone Is incredible. I was standing right next to a power washer, speaking to my wife with the Sony's, and she could not hear the power washer and heard me perfectly. I definitely recommend the Sony's. They are a little bit less expensive and I think they of are of equal or not better sound. Let me restate that. They definitely have better sound than the Bose. The noise canceling is as good or better. No matter what set of headphones that you purchase, I would definitely purchase the extended warranty. I think buying the warranty is priceless.

R3V27GZ2MQ76FU,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to QC35,jharmon,5,"This review is going to be based on how much of an upgrade these are compared to the QC35.Sound: Short answer is they are noticeably better even without the immersive sound option. The bass can “hit” much harder and has a richer deeper sound. I thought that the QC35 did a fantastic job of putting me in the environment of the music I was listening to, but the Ultra’s do an even better job. I like to have a headspace of escape when I use my headphones while I work and these do an even better job. I’ll be honest about the immersive audio feature that I am not sure it’s something I value. I have tried to listen to songs repeatedly with it on and off, it I do not feel it adds much to the experience. Perhaps my viewpoint will change with time.User Interface: The multi-function button has more options than the QC35 button. I like the volume slider vs buttons because it allows you to make smaller volume adjustments vs pre-determine volume adjustments. You keep your finger on the touch slider and move it slowly. I wish Bose had used the touch panel option for the track management like they did on the 700. Clicking the multi-function button 2x to go forward; 3x to go backward. 4x is set in the app whatever you want it to do. The headphones will go into stand-by if you lay the cups flat on a table or surface. The LED will pulse slowly to know you are in stand-by. I have left my QC35 on many times to come back disappointed to find them dead. Then when you pick them up and put them on your ears they come out of sleep mode. USB-C is nice, the QC35 was micro-usb and I don’t tend to use that style of cable anymore.Build: The hinges on this seem to be more sturdy than the qc35. The hinge action is smooth with no clicking. The headband is a bit sturdier as well. The cushions are a bit more stiff than the QC35 so hopefully that leads to more longevity because the older style tends to wear out and you have to replace them.APP: One thing that hampers the QC35 more than the new version of the headphone which I think is the QC35II and later is the options available in the Bose Music App verses the Bose Connect App. The Bose Music has much better fined tuned features with regards to the noise cancellation options and equalizer settings. The QC45 and 700 I know use the Bose MusicMic: I have used this for many phone calls and virtual meetings. I haven’t received any complaints about being heard or being clear.","Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2023",AGOVEPTEREULH6ONEIG6745WD2WQ,True,21,Color: Black

My old ones were micro-usb....Cons:-I don't like the button layout. My old quiet comforts were very easy to figure out with the slider. I always knew when they were on/ off, and what mode they were in. These require you to hold down on certain buttons to turn them off, switch modes, etc. It's not very intuitive and almost forces you to use the app to figure out what's going on.-You STILL cannot charge the headset while listening. Had this same problem with my 2019 Quiet Comforts. Surprised to see they haven't figured this out.-Battery life is improved but not nearly enough.-App is buggy and takes awhile to connect.-STILL has the random issue of no audio output if connected to two devices in certain circumstances. In my experience, this happens if connected to a laptop and a phone.Overall it's not a huge upgrade over my previous set and still has the same bugs/limitations. As the image indicate, I'm not crazy about the button layout. I miss the tactile slider of the old QCII because it didn't leave you guessing what the headphones are doing.","Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2024",AGIRXVAAEQD2XLNXQB5PHVFTLDVQ,True,2,Color: Black

R2G48287JTAWWN,B0CCZ1L489,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound quality and noise cancel, questionable other features",Trenton Woodham,4,"I had a previous generation Quiet Comfort before this pair, and compared to that, this pair feels much better in terms of sound quality. The noise cancellation is actually quite good, and I appreciate the “Aware” mode, though perhaps having a noise cancellation slider would be better. Another area of improvement is the distance it can maintain connection. I can walk considerable farther away from my phone and the audio in the headphones remains clear. The headphones are pretty comfortable, thought sometimes listening for long periods of time while wearing glasses can cause some soreness. The battery life is pretty good, though I suggest fully powering off the headphones when done rather than relying on the low power mode. Where this product starts to lose points with me is the auto-pause/sleep feature for when you remove the headphones. A lot of times, this feature will trigger when I’m in the middle of listening to something. Perhaps it’s due to a particular head movement, or something else, but I find myself having to manually resume playback despite not having taking the headphones off. I wish this feature had a toggle as I’d much rather forgo the sleep feature and just power the device on/off manually than worry about whether my audio is going to stop because I looked right. Ultimately the audio quality is most important, but minor annoyances hold this product back from better excellent.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024",AE3JMSFIXDM66MHF25KQJWCLRFIA,True,9,Color: Black

R2YP4ID328PUTK,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Sounding Bose Headphones I Have Ever Heard!,Aluzion TV,5,"These are simply the best Bose headphones I have ever heard. Usually Bose has made headphones that are lacking in Bass and while that works for a lot of people, it never worked for me. Im happy to report that these headphones have really nice punchy bass and an EQ in the Bose Music App that you can tune these headphones to your exact liking.The app is good and all works well.- The Multi-Point connection takes a little time to understand how it works. You can have up to 2 devices connected at the same time, but you have to stop the audio on the first device before you can start the second device. Once you learn that it works great. *Within the ""Sources"" section of the Bose Music App you can mage all connected devices and I believe you can store up to 8 devices here. Each device will have an On/Off slider that you can choose to have active at the same time as your phone or main device.I like this because I have both of my TV's, My iMac, iPad and phone saved here and can choose which devices I want to listen to by turning on or off that specific slider.- The sound quality of these headphones is honestly what I have been looking for, for sometime.I listen to Dance and EDM a lot and these headphones sound amazing. Plenty of Bass that is clear and punchy. You can fine tune everything within the EQ section of the Bose Music App. This is something that I honestly love about using these headphones. ALL HEADPHONES should have an adjustable EQ that stays with the headphones not just in an app.- The battery life has also been very good no complaints here.- The weight of these headphones is simply awesome for carrying around in my backpack and wearing them. It's almost like you're not wearing anything at all! Very comfortable and lightweight. I use them on the train everyday and I am very happy.- The case is also amazing. The headphones fold down and pack very nicely into this really nicely constructed case. It's also one of my favorite things about these headphones. Having a nice custom case from the manufacturer is where it's at. Aftermarket cases for most things tend to not have perfect fitment or build quality and can be bulky.There’s more but honestly I think I covered the most import things and I def recommend them.","Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2024",AGUIDLDIOAE4GTNEFYZ4HSFY52RA,True,66,Color: Black

R26VVYH3J8A929,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best of the Best!,LAMGA1,5,"I purchased the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones from Amazon and am very impressed! Bose has always been at the top of list for the best headphones and these do not disappoint! First off, they are very light and comfortable. The ear cups feel large and the speakers are angled in the headphones to give your ears plenty of space and direct the sound into them. Downloading the Bose Music App allows you to control the settings. One thing I love is the ability to connect two devices via Bluetooth at the same time. For example, you can connect the app on your phone and an iPod or speaker at the same time and control them both.The headphones have three modes: Quiet Mode, Aware Mode, and Immersive Audio Mode. Quiet Mode gives the most noise reduction, and even with a fan or air conditioner running nearby is impressively quiet. Aware Mode allows you to hear what is going on around you and still hear the music. The newest mode and what makes the Ultra headphones unique is the spatial audio feature called Immersive Audio. This mode plays the music as if it is coming from in front of you. You can choose one of two modes: Still Mode for sitting still and Motion Mode for walking or moving around. In Still Mode, the music is always only in front of you so if you turn your head, you hear it out of only one ear cup and vice versa when you turn your head the other way. In Motion Mode, the music is always in front of you so as you turn your head, it moves to stay in front of you. This is by far my new favorite mode.As far as controls, the Ultra headphones only have two buttons and a volume slider on the right ear cup. These control the Bluetooth connection and pause, skip forward, or skip backward. The volume slider is a unique feature that It is located on the right earcup and by sliding your finger along it can raise and lower the volume. I like the idea, but it does not always work well for me. You can also customize the slider so that by tapping it, the headphones will tell you how much battery life is left. Removing the headphones pauses the music and putting them back on resumes it. You can also set the duration for how long until they power off in the Bose Music App.I do think the price point is a little high for the segment; but overall, I really do like these new Ultra headphones and highly recommend them!","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",AEWHPVCVF23XWQRIUOMKSVNZG7JA,True,20,Color: Black
R195JPWMXEMTMP,B0CCZ1L489,3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and noise cancellation but not always an upgrade from QC 45,Jeremiah Brandt,3,"I bought the QC Ultra with high hopes to replace my older QC 45 that was starting to have problems. I've used Bose headphones including QC 35 II and QC 45 since 2021. I use Bose headphones because they have good sound quality and are very comfortable. The sound quality and noise cancellation of QS Ultra was noticeably better than the older Bose headphones I used. The comfort of the QS 45 matches older Bose headphones. After using the QC Ultra for a couple of days, I returned them and bought a new pair of QS 45 to replace my older QC 45. Overall the QC Ultra are better is several aspects, but because of the cons listed below I prefer the QC 45.Pros:- Great sound quality: The sound quality of the QC Ultra is excellent. I noticed the sound quality is slightly better than my QC 45.- Great noise cancellation: The noisecancellation of the QC Ultra is better than my previous QC 45. I noticed little difference between my last QC 45 and these.- Very comfortable: The QC Ultra, like my previous QC 45, are very comfortable and I can wear them all day.Cons:- No physical button for volume control: The volume control is a slider. I found it difficult to set the volume to the lowest setting using the slider. Buttons make this much easer because I just needed to click until volume was turned off then up one click.- No dedicated physical button for power: The headphones are supposed to turn off automatically when you put them away. There is a button you can long press to turn off the headphones. I found the long press too time-consuming and found the physical power switch on my QC 45 to be more intuitive, faster, and convenient.- Automatic pauses are unpredictable: The QC Ultra is supposed to pause media automatically whenever they are taken off. I found that sometimes when I'm turning my head or opening my jaw wide the headphones would pause media. This was very annoying. I also lie down wearing headphones on one ear. The QC Ultra automatically turn of media when only wearing one ear. It's possible to unpause media through your phone. However, if you shift your head, the QC Ultra will typically pause media again. This was also annoying and not a problem with the QS 45.","Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2024",AHJWSXX57Q42X4YFS4HLSB3Y7GDA,True,16,Color: Black
R1VCE67YU7ENPU,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Bose Does it Again,Elaine,5,"Let me start by saying, I am an audiophile and I am constantly trying new headphones and new audio technology. In my opinion, Bose still stands far above the competetion in most catagories. The crisp sound, unmatched comfort, and superior noise cancelling set these QuietComfort Ultra headphones apart from everything I have used. I travel a lot for work and I am constantly grabbing this headset for the airport, loud flights, and just leisure music listening.Design:As you take the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones out of the case you will immediately note that it has the same sleek curves and overall clean appearance of a Bose product. The case fits the headphones perfectly with enough room for small accessories like a charging and auxiliary chord.Comfort:These are easily the most comfortable pair of headphones I have ever used. The ear cushions are made of the distinct Bose memory foam and they are fully adjustable to any head size. I wore them on a 8-hour long-haul flight and my head didnt hurt or have suction/red marks from overuse. I was incredibly impressed.Intuitiveness:The controls and simplicity of the button layout is something that I really started to like. The volume is a simple swipe up or down on the side of the headset and the multi-function button is intuitive and does exactly what you would expect. I found that using the app for things like connecting bluetooth and adjusting sound modes worked better than pressing buttons on the headphones themselves.Battery Life:My only small complaint is that using Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) and playing louder music, the battery tends to drain somewhat faster than I expected. After a full charge I find that the headset will drop to 60-70% fairly fast. That being said, the battery has never run out on me, not even once.Noise Cancelling:This headset is far and away the best noise cancelling I have ever experienced with headphones, and I have tried all the major brands. I would say the ANC is slightly better than previous generation Bose headsets. Also, I did not notice fatigure or ANC induced headaches, which is a huge plus. I feel like you can literally enter your own quiet world in a busy space like an airport or aircraft, and for me that is everything.Overall:This headset is the marquee of excellent sound quality, unmatched comfort, and the best noise cancelling on the market. The headset looks great on your head and sounds even better than it looks. Bose does it again.","Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2023",AGFNIYBZ7EMW3CTBLV2E75KRRI3Q,True,130,Color: White Smoke

Ok I'll talk about the sound quality and features - Wow, wow, wow!! I REALLY love the Immersion setting. Basically, the Immersion setting means the noise cancelling option is to the highest level so the sound is REALLY crisp and no outside sounds interferes with whatever you are listening to. I was really blown away by the musical theater video I was listening to. The noise cancelling feature is REALLY superb. I was also in my room with an air purifier on - which is loud by the way. The Bose noise cancelling feature REALLY dimmed the sound of my air purifier. I would say it blocked 85 - 90% of the air purifier sound. Next are the controls. I've only been using the volume controls and it is the right side of the headphones. It's really cool that it's touch sensitive. There are no buttons - you just slide your finger up and down. The volume control is VERY responsive which is really cool. When I take the headphones off it automatically pauses the video or song (neat!) I like the fact that I won't be ""wearing out"" any buttons. As for comfort I love the fact that it DEFINITELY fits over my ears. I have no fear of pinched ears and lack of blood flow. The headphone pads is very soft, plush and comfortable. I stretched the headphone to its maximum length and it was good for my head. The feel of everything was just slick and smooth . I haven't tested the battery yet. I will update once I do. the case is great and easy to use. It has a hole for the pads which is pretty convenient. I will be using the case because this Bose headphone costs a few dollars. I don't have to mention that this uses USB-C and they provide the cord. I also like the fact that I can connect two different devices. I have android and there were no issues connecting to it but I made sure to download the Bose app. There is an IMMERSION DEMO which sounds VERY cool and you really get to hear the high quality audio features. I had no problems connecting it to my Windows computer. Very happy with my headphones.

My one minor gripe which I won't fault the product for because it may be my head shape.Since this unit doesn't use a locking mechanism for the ear position, it's difficult for me to find the proper spot to comfortably wear the ear cups. On the QC45's I knew that one click on each side was the perfect fit, so when I traveled with them and took them out of the case it was a single click on each side and I was good to go. When I take these out of the travel case I have to fiddle with them to get the proper position.

Besides, most negative and positive reviews can be fake anyway, lol.I was questioning whether I should buy these or not due to many negative reviews, but then I realized most people only review here to complain, and it’s true that every product has a 2-10% chance of being faulty. Anyway, I’m glad I made the purchase. I’ve had AirPods Max, Sony XM5, and Beats Studio, but so far, the Ultra is a beast and amazing.I can hear every instrument, and the bass is quite good; it’s not overwhelming like the XM5. Like the bass is not distracting; it’s definitely a bassy headphone, but unlike the XM5 or Beats Studio, where the bass muffles other sounds. The immersive feature is a bit gimmicky, but it does surprise me. The volume control is odd I don’t like it, wish there was physical button besides the slider.The weight is amazing, and I’d say it’s probably the most comfortable headphone I have in my collection. I’ve worn it for 6 hours straight studying without any issues. Unlike the Apple Max, it’s definitely lightweight and comfortable. However, the build is very light and plasticky, but it doesn’t feel cheap at all, if you're wondering; it just feels extremely light.Portability is okay; the case is not my favorite, but it does the trick. It’s just annoying that you have to reset the strap height every time you try to fit it inside the case. However, the battery in this thing is quite good, not amazing, but very good. I can listen consecutively for 16 hours with 10% battery left, and that’s with noise cancellation on (your experience can vary depending on the volume you’re listening to; I listen to my music at around 75% to 80% volume) all the time, so yeah, it can drain battery.It’s an amazing pair of headphones, so if you have the money for it, why not?","Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,True,27,Color: Black

Just to be clear, I still love these headphones.The Bose QC Ultra has a feature where if you take one earphone off your head, they auto-pause what is playing. I don't personally like this feature because sometimes I don't want to pause when I take one cup off my head. I would rather always press a button.A second small gripe I have is that these earcups are a bit more hard than previous iterations. I have a pair of QCII's and I much prefer the soft comfort of those earcups to the slightly more firm padding on the QC Ultra.The final thing is the volume control. I am not a fan of touch controls and they have decided to go with a touch slider on this iteration. If my hand is a bit sweaty, it will stutter along the surface for inconsistent volume control. I would rather have physical buttons.Other than these small things, this set of headphones is superb.

RK19PT2S7F9,B0CCZ1L489,4.0 out of 5 stars My New Fav!!!,Josh L.,4,Only used for a few days but higher impressed already. First thing is that the sound is amazing! First pair of Bose headphones so my comparisons are with my previous Sony XM4s and my brief try of Airpods Max from my friend. Noise cancellation is amazing and I say slightly better than Sony but again this is the XM4 I used not the new XM5 so I had less of that white noise swoosh sound used in that mode. Transparency also impressive sounding natural and again a step above Sony but still believe Apple leads in both features. Now sound yes like the ability to custom EQ and played around for the sound and like it but Sony does have more presets and EQ bands and bass adjustments so wish Bose had more of that but still got the sound that worked for me. The headphones are also comfortable but wish they extended the headband just a little more and slightly bigger earcups but over a few days just had to break them in for my ears and get used to wearing them. Also great that they fold and the nice case and the new XM5 doesn't fold and bigger case so that's why I didn't upgrade from XM4. Another con is wired mode has to be with headphones on with battery so that's sort of new with wired supposed to work without power as backup. These still are now my main headphones and will for years but again updates for more EQ settings would be nice.,"Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2023",AHJWDUM5GCWRL3FLEMJYU3WJ3OHA,True,3,Color: Black

As an avid music enthusiast, frequent traveler, and love of movies in a loud and busy household, these headphones have improved my audio experiences in ways I never knew were possible.First and foremost, the noise cancellation is unparalleled. The moment you put these on, the outside world fades away. However, it still offers the ability to be aware of your surroundings when needed without stoping your audio. I'll be honest, I thought that spatial audio may be more of a marketing gimmick, but it is incredible. Especially when watching movies, when you turn your head, the sound moves with you providing the feeling of being immersed in the moment.Comfort is another standout feature. In my use case, I am wearing the headphones for prolonged periods of time, and most of the time you almost forget you have them on. However, the new head-on detection is really cool. The moment you slip the headphone of your ear, your entertainment pauses, and then when it is back in place, your entertainment seamlessly starts back up.If you are traveling you don't need to worry about the headphones going out on you, because the battery life is incredible. As with all Bose products the craftmanship and quality is top-notch. I have been hesitant to purchase Bose headphones in the past because I just didn't think that I would be able to tell enough of a difference. I was wrong.Overall, you will not be disappointed with these headphones, the only minor issues that I have run into are the fact that Bose utilizes two different apps to control their devices, so I was previously using Bose Connect, and the headphones require Bose Music. And although you don't really need the app once you have set them up, it would be nice to have that experience streamlined. I have also noticed that sometimes a new blue-tooth pairing can be a little finicky, but overall is very good.I am beyond excited to have these headphones, and it has added so much to my entertainment enjoyment.","Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2023",AGVE2CUYS4QEWISNATJ422HF3BIA,True,6,Color: Black

The stock EQ curve is really bad in my opinion. After just a few minutes I had them sounding great. The spatial audio isn't great, however. Pros mix albums of music to be listened to in stereo, and it's best to listen to it the way they intended. This spatial audio is interesting but it's a gimmick.The dealbreaker for me is that these do not clamp on my head much at all. They move around when I turn my head or look down. They move around so much that it makes a loud sound when I try to move at a decent speed with them on. I would like to be able to do a light jog with these on but there is no way I could hear the media while jogging due to the headphones bouncing up and down on my head. Earbuds are much much better for me. Maybe my head is smaller than I thought. If you have a small head, don't buy these.They did not disappoint in terms of comfort, ease of use and sound.

I road trip a lot with children and needed some quiet time to get some work done, and my husband works in an office where he is constantly doing virtual meetings. These headphones have made both of these things a huge upgrade! The different modes are helpful as well. In the car I had on ""aware"" mode and was able to hear if my kids were asking me for something but could not hear that my husband had some music playing on the radio pretty loud. So crazy how you can hear one thing but it completely blocks out another!I wanted to learn more about the immersion mode so I downloaded the app. I usually don't like downloading an app for every product I have, but the demo was so useful and it explained how immersion mode works and OH MY GOSH it is so cool, it really makes you feel like you are actually seeing someone perform live.We had some confusion connecting them and learning to switch back and forth between different phones at first but it does get easier. The fact the headset only has two buttons makes it a learning curve at first to remember how many times to push the button for answering calls, ending them, skipping forward a song, skipping backward, etc gets a little confusing but once you have it down its hard to forget. My husband said they work really well for his business calls and he can hear clearly and his co workers can understand him very well. Only complaint would be I found they put too much pressure on my head that I could not adjust away. I was constantly pulling a side up to relieve the pressure, so long term use isn't for me but I was the only one that tried them in my family that had this problem. Otherwise they were quite comfortable!

RR2BBF10DJ1YI,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Best noise cancelling headphones money can buy.,Bryan,5,"These are not perfect as headphones go, but they are literally the nicest noise cancelling headphones that any amount of money can buy. They have their ups and downs. I'm going to talk in depth about each of these, but overall these are the best noise cancelling headphones money can buy, so even when it comes to their downsides, you can't do better.First, if you're a regular consumer, you'll be blown away by the sound quality. However, if you're an audiophile used to audiophile grade open back headphones like the Sennheiser HD800, these fall short of audiophile levels of sound quality. Let me explain why that is.Sound quality wise, the sound quality is overall spectacular, but it has two problems. Bass is way overemphasized, and the treble is rolled off. The treble issue is in my opinion the only really major flaw you have to deal with in these headphones. It's really a shame. Even with EQ, there's no good way to make up for the treble problem because the high end is just always a little lacking.Bass is massively overemphasized, but everyone seems to do that these days, and most people seem to love it. Thankfully, you can just lower the bass in the EQ and it works fine, but from an audiophile perspective it's still a mark against it. You can also raise the bass if you want to lose your hearing and cause brain damage from the thump. These things will thump so hard that it'll give you a concussion.Aside from those two downsides, instruments sound absolutely spectacular with amazing definition, separation, and clarity, it's just really unfortunate that they rolled off the treble. It'd be nice if the bass wasn't so overemphasized, but the bass at least is understandable since it seems to be what most people want. I will say however that the mid is absolutely spectacular, so there's that.Even at their best, if you're a real audiophile, these don't hold up to the sound quality of high end audiophile open back headphones by Sennheiser like the HD650 or HD800. These are consumer grade, very top end consumer grade, but they don't reach the heights of real audiophile territory. For most people though, these will blow you away.Noise cancelling wise, these are the best money can buy. I've tried other noise cancelling headphones, and these destroy everything that I've ever tried. It's a night and day difference in terms of the overall quality and effectiveness of the noise cancelling compared to other noise cancelling headphones.However, they're not totally perfect. I have a bunch of air filter fans running full blast all the time, and it reduces their volume by 90+%, but it's a little inconsistent. Some of the inconsistency comes from just how the headphones sit in my head, if I get them just right, it mutes probably 98% of the sound, but if they're just a little off, it drops to between 90-95%. Sometimes it just seems to work better than other times with no apparent explanation. 90% is still a ton of noise reduction. Be aware though that you can still hear things, they're just quiet. Like if you pass a fan while walking, you can still hear it, it's just quiet.There is sometimes a slight amount of pressure from the noise cancellation, but it's very minimal, and a lot of the time there's actually none.Next, we get into the real premium stuff. You're paying like $400 for this, so let's talk about what you're really paying for: the creature comforts and luxury that get overlooked at lower price ranges...For example, the case for these headphones is simply amazing. It feels extremely premium, it has a nice touch, it's light but durable, it has this lovely leathery material that is a joy to hold. It just feels like a million bucks. Even the zipper is nice! The internal layout is likewise spacious, protective and just overall very high quality.Same with the headphones themselves. As an object that you hold in your hand, these things simply feel incredible. They're unbelievably light, I don't know how they made it feel this light. The headband literally feels like a cloud, it almost melts in your hand. I've never felt anything like it. It is insanely soft with this beautiful smooth leather feeling, yet it doesn't collapse when you wear it. I don't even understand how that works, but it does.These are the most comfortable set of headphones I have ever put on my head by far. It feels like you're wearing a cloud. It's crazy. The clamp force is so low that I can wear these for hours and hours on end and they just feel insanely comfortable the entire time.Even just holding these headphones physically, they feel like a million bucks. Like they've got these buttery smooth moving collapsible cans, yet they feel solid and durable, and they have this lovely smooth feeling to them.These are the things you're really paying for when you pay $400. It's just all those little details and luxuries that really make it. They put a lot of luxury into the things outside the actual speakers, and it shows. They feel super premium in your hands, they're a beautiful shape, they're insanely comfortable to wear, they have this elegant simple design to them, and their case is outstanding. Seriously, if you hold the case and headphones of any of the other noise cancelling headphones in your hands, they just don't feel as nice as this.Overall, I really wish they hadn't rolled off the treble. That's its one major flaw. However, these are so good that I can't go back to anything else (other than my open back audiophile sennheisers for serious listening). These are like the ultimate casual headphones for every day use. Watching TV? Use these. Going on an airplane? Use these. Going to the gym? Use these. Going for a walk? Use these. Unless all you want to do is sit down and seriously listen to some high quality music in a quiet room with audiophile headphones, you should be using these.These are your ultimate every day use headphones. If you're a normal consumer who doesn't care about audiophile grade stuff, these will absolutely blow your mind. Even if you're an audiophile, you'll probably end up addicted to them for every day normal use. I'm kindof addicted to them myself, to be honest.","Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2024",AEU5UJKGXQ6DSRMACQYMYZ5IG26A,True,285,Color: Black
R3ODEWU6VR0GD7,B0CCZ1L489,"5.0 out of 5 stars Bose's best offering to date if you value sound quality, comfort, and ANC",Oliver,5,"I own the Bose QC45 and have recently tried comparable headphones in this class including the B&W PX7 S2 and Sennheiser Momentum 4. The Bose QC Ultra are probably the best among this group when it comes to my top three priorities - sound quality, comfort, and ANC. Here are my relative rankings in these categories:SOUND QUALITYI was a bit skeptical at first that Bose's new Immersion Mode would amount to a mere marketing gimmick, but it's really unlike anything that I've ever heard. It's hard to describe (you have to listen for yourself!). Immersion Mode somehow gives the sense that the audio source is in front of you (almost like speakers), which ultimately creates a more expansive, 3D-ish effect that makes the music ""come alive."" I now listen exclusively in Immersion Mode and don't know that I can go back to the more traditional, ""closed-off"" sound of other headphones. The QC Ultra is a definite step-up from the QC45.I was also impressed with the B&W PX7 S2's balanced and clean sound signature; however, I had to return my pair because the left ear cup suddenly and inexplicably went dead after only a week of gentle use. I contemplated repurchasing because of how good they sound but don't want to take the chance on receiving another dud.While the M4 has a loyal following, I was personally disappointed by the Sennheiser sound signature. The M4 was too bass-heavy for my taste; moreover, the clarity/separation for vocals and instruments was muddy and often overpowered by the bass.Rankings: QC Ultra >= PX7 S2 > QC45 > M4COMFORTBoth the QC45 and QC Ultra live up to the ""comfort"" in their names. Their light weight and plush padding are second to none, with perhaps a slight edge to the QC45. The PX7 S2 is also quite pleasant to wear but a little heavier compared to Bose. I was not a fan of the M4, which felt a bit cheap to me; the material used for the ear pads was not breathable (think hot ears), and the clamping force was tighter than Bose and B&W.Rankings: QC45 >= QC Ultra > PX7 S2 > M4ANCBose has earned a reputation as the ""King of ANC"", a title that is well-deserved IMO. Both the QC45 and QC Ultra are noticeably more effective at drowning out ambient noise than the PX7 S2 and M4.Rankings: QC Ultra = QC45 > PX7 S2 = M4Hope that my observations help you if you're trying to decide between these headphone options. I plan to keep the QC Ultra as Bose has made substantial improvements to the QC45, namely the Immersion Mode, that justify the price differential for me. I do wish that the battery life were longer, but its other distinguishing features make up for it. Overall, I'd give the QC Ultra 4.5 (rounding up to 5) stars!","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AH7Z7HSRSEDGQAGZRQG6E2CRVRRQ,True,77,Color: White Smoke

Headphone this pricey should not be irritating and unpredictable.I am searching for alternatives.Update 2 weeks later:I definitely prefer the Immersion Mode for well done recordings. It has a more open soundstage and reduces some of the excessive bass and thickness present in Music Mode. In poorer or older streams there can be some artifacts that are created.Original review:I have Audio Technica M50x (warmer/bassy; closed back) and Grado SR60 (airy, open back). I've had the Sony MDR7406 (loved these - well balanced - but the non-replaceable cord was a problem). These were all wired.These new Bose met my expectations, especially for BT.Still getting used to controls. I like both the Music and Immersive settings. The Music setting is a bit warmer with more separated stereo. The immersive is a bit more centered, slightly thinner, and more spacious sounding.I find the volume control to be easy to access, convenient and responsive.The three equalizer settings are good for tweaks - I'd like to know their center points, like is bass centered at 100, mid at 1,000, highs at 10,000? I have no idea.As with most BT devices, auto reconnect can be a little unpredictable. The range takes me throughout my 1,300 sq ft house through 2 or 3 walls with no skips.Overall, I'm very happy with the audio quality, my main objective for wireless phones.

R2YCVGCT28KXGR,B0CCZ1L489,"3.0 out of 5 stars Sound is flat, but battery life is great.",iWillBreakFree,3,"I have used these headphones almost daily since June 2023 and do not like them. I wish I could return them for something else. I purchased these because I liked their Bose Sport Earbuds, but those were starting to cause earwax to clog up my ear canals. So I decided to buy these to focus on school and work. I wanted to drown out background noise, so I didn't get distracted, which happens easily to me. ""Oh, look, a potato chip!"" - plays with the potato chip. I still use the earbuds when I work out and they function very well for that purpose. Anyways, lets get on with it, here are a few pro's and many con'sPro:1. Battery life is accurate. I normally get about 24 hours of battery life out of them. I'm not timing it, I judge it based on the number of days used which is about 4 days before needing a charge.2. Noise canceling is fantastic. I will sometimes be working in the living room; someone else can be blasting the TV, and it sounds like quiet muddled background noise.Con:1. The expectation of sound quality is terrible, considering the price I paid for them. The sound quality is very flat and muddy, and there is little to no sound separation. I can get similar quality headphones for a quarter of the amount spent on these headphones.2. Comfort is very dependent on your head shape. But with mine, they start to hurt on top of my head where the band is and behind the lower part of my ear. I've adjusted them so they don't squeeze so hard, but they become too loose and easily fall off.3. Auto-Pause is annoying. You have an auto-pause option when you pull them off your right ear. That being said, when I turn my head, they will pause for no reason. It's annoying because there is times it doesn't recognize that it's back on your ears and not play. This means you need to use your phone or press the assigned button each time to start playing. You will need to loosen them a little to stop this, but they can easily fall off. This leaves you to decide if you want them to fall off easily or for it to auto-pause frequently almost every time you turn your head. So, if you plan on using these to work out with, it can be distracting and ruin your flow.4. Bose App. First, the app could be more worthwhile. It allows you to assign the shortcut button on your headphones to very basic features like Hearing Battery Level, Change Immersive Audio, Voice Assistant, and Spotify. A long hold on this button will change your noise-cancelling option. But the app is almost never updated unless it's for some advertisement and never adds any features to your headphones.5. Bose App - EQ. It doesn't You can use this to ""adjust"" the eq, but it only gives you bass/mid/treble and really doesn't do anything to help with the sound quality. If you listen to multiple genres of music like I do, you want the option to have some preset eq settings, but without a proper adjustment of the EQ, it really doesn't matter.6. Bose App/Immersive Audio. This is just marketing crap. If you have it on, when you turn your head to any side, the sound will shift over to the opposite side. That's all. It ruins the sound more when it's on, so I always have it off.7. Wearing the headphones. Not really that bad of a feature. You need to place them on correctly. They have R/L inside each cup and will only work on those sides. So, if you are like me and place them flat on your desk, there is a learning curve to make sure you place them correctly on your head.Conclusion:Save your money. I would recommend other headphones, but I am not made of money and don't have a ton of different headphones to suggest. Please take another look at other options in this price range. Bose, if you read this, can we talk about returning them so I can get my money back, I still have the original case that these came with.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AFO2DKPA3M27JFTIWXGRSBDVGFZQ,True,14,Color: Black
R24X8QCZ5R5EJA,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones in the market!,Amir Hasani,5,"Initial Impressions:From the moment I unboxed the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, I was struck by their sleek, sophisticated design. The headphones are incredibly light, and the plush ear cushions felt luxurious the moment I put them on. Powering them up for the first time, I was greeted by a user-friendly voice prompt that guided me through the Bluetooth connection process, which was quick and seamless.Build Quality & Design:The build quality of these headphones is exactly what you would expect from Bose—robust yet refined. They sport a minimalistic style, with a focus on comfort and durability. The materials used are top-notch, ensuring that the headphones not only last but also retain their aesthetic appeal over time. The ear cups rotate and fold neatly, making them perfect for travel and storage.Sound Quality:Bose has always been a pioneer in sound technology, and these headphones are no exception. The sound clarity is exceptional, with rich bass, crisp highs, and detailed mids. Whether I'm listening to classical music, hard rock, or cinematic scores, every genre is rendered with precision and depth. The active noise cancelling function is superb, effectively blocking out external noises and creating an immersive listening environment.Wireless Connectivity:The Bluetooth connectivity is flawless, with a strong and stable connection. I can wander around my house with the headphones on without any drop in audio quality or interruptions. Additionally, the multi-connect feature allows the headphones to be connected to two devices simultaneously, which is a great convenience.Battery Life:The battery life is impressive. On a single charge, I can get up to 20 hours of playtime with noise cancelling on, which is more than enough for a day's use or a long flight. The quick charge feature is also a lifesaver, providing hours of playtime with just a few minutes of charging.Additional Features:One standout feature is the adjustable noise cancelling, which allows you to modify the level of noise cancellation depending on your environment. The touch-sensitive controls on the ear cups are intuitive, providing easy access to volume, track control, and voice assistants.Final Thoughts:The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are a testament to what high-quality headphones can offer. They provide a perfect blend of style, comfort, and superior sound quality, with noise cancelling that truly stands out in busy environments. Whether for travel, work, or just enjoying your favorite tunes at home, these headphones are an excellent investment. They earn a well-deserved five stars for elevating my audio experience beyond expectations.","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2024",AFWHMQCSZG6TLEWC6FVIHKWOQY4A,True,17,Color: Black
RGSDD50WQC9SO,B0CCZ1L489,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great noise cancelling, call quality, and sound. Terrible everything else.",User312938,3,"I have owned numerous QC35's, QC45's, and a pair of 700s. I've tried some Sony's but never used them as my daily driver. I wear my headphones nearly all day while I work, go to the gym, take walks, and frequently when falling asleep. These are a a substantial upgrade over previous Bose headphones in the sound department, but a MAJOR downgrade in literally every other way.Pros-Fantastic noise cancelling-Great call quality-Good sound quality-Fold flatCons-Much flimsier (at the hinge) than QC45-Volume adjuster is basically useless for anything other than large changes. Trying to get just the right volume while listening to a podcast? Have damp fingers at the gym? Have long hair? In a quiet room and need fine adjustments? Don't even bother using the headphone volume slider.-Ear cups are slightly smaller and less soft than QC45-Ear cups wear out much faster than QC45-Power button functioning is inconsistent. Sometimes it does nothing, sometimes has a long pause. No correlation to on head detection. It's just such a step back from the QC45-Sometimes reboots randomly-Immersive audio is gimmic, or at the very least isn't compatible with a very active lifestyle and using these headphones in many daily environments-On head detection/auto off works inconsistently when wearing them while head against a pillow-These things just waste your time. Want to turn them off - hold the button and count to 3. So you probably had to think about it for a total of 4 seconds. If you turn them off 5 times in a day, that's 20 seconds a day. If I do that say 6 days a week, I'm spending 2 minutes per week just thinking about turning my headphones off. That's 104 minutes per year I'm literally thinking about turning these stupid things off. Want to check the battery level? You have to wait for them to do the boot cycle, then speak to you, then turn them off by holding the off button for 3 seconds.-Nitpick vs QC45 #1: no quick way to just feel the headphone and know which side is R/L to put them on your head. There's a tiny button you can try to find, but it's not like the On/Off switch you could feel on the QC45-Nitpick vs QC45 #2: The button to turn them off is on the side of the headphone WITHOUT the USB C power jack, so have to move them in your hands, then plug them in.-not water proofI feel like Bose decided they had to follow Sony and Apple in trying to keep up with ""modern features"" and style, but in doing so they really have lost a lot of the great functionality that made the previous models so amazing.The next good over-ear headphones I invest in will probably not be Bose.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2024",AHU45EABLFNNPWPHAHU42RJ67U6Q,True,89,Color: Black
RW608C3GWLZZA,B0CCZ1L489,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent sound quality but some minor build quality issues,Rocky Soamc,4,"I'm fairly picky about my noise canceling headphones. I've owned Sony XM-5, Sony XM-4, Bose Quiet Comfort 700 and these outperform all of those by at least a small but noticable amount. The ANC isn't magic, but it is as effective as anything I've used. On a recent flight I had a screaming infant about 3 rows back and while it couldn't block all of the sound, it barely intruded and wasn't noticable when a song was actively playing. Sound quality is excellent and the immersive audio feature is a welcome addition. My only gripe as far as audio quality is that Bose seems to subscribe to Apple's philosophy about the user experience: they're going to put some effort into creating a nice experience, but you'd better agree at least on the broad strokes of what makes for a nice user experience because they don't give you much wiggle room to customize it. I'd like to be able to tune the sound to my liking a little bit more. Bose keeps the EQ simple--a little too simple for my tastes--with the option only to adjust low mid and high. Compared to what Sony's app offers this feels very restrictive. A few more bands on the EQ would be a welcome addition.My only complaints are minor: After two months of daily use, the stitching on the ear pads has come apart with about 60% of the stitching on each side separated already. At this price point, I'd expect better durability and longevity. Replacement pads range from about $22 to $35, so this isn't a meaningless complaint.The other minor annoyance is I wish these had a little bit more ""clamping power"" in the headband. I understand that you have to strike a balance between squeezing somebody's head like it's in a vice and the headphones staying in place no matter what you're doing with your head, but these err a little too much on the loose side. Clearly these aren't intended to use as your workout headphones, but even just lying down on a flat bench is generally going to make them come off your ears.Everything else seems to function properly and be holding up well and I do not regret the purchase. They're very expensive, but not necessarily a bad value. I had to work pretty hard to justify a $400 set of headphones, but if it's something that you'll use enough and effective noise cancelling is a must have, these might barely edge into the "" justifiable luxury"" column, but will never be anywhere near ""practical"".","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2024",AFH7EWSZGJ5SANZTGPSUR4CWONZQ,True,18,Color: Black
RMARAQXAFN8Z9,B0CCZ1L489,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent!,SawyerMan,5,"To start out, I must say I am very fussy about audio. I have a small recording studio, which I spend at least eight hours a day in. I have three different sets of headphones, which all have a personality of their own when it comes to sound and mixing, I have a couple of Bose speakers which are excellent and have always been impressed with their products. I did not buy these with the intent of mixing, just for listening out of the studio. Most headphones don’t reflect what a good pair of studio monitors produce. These headphones , do an excellent job of reproducing accurate recordings, good and bad. The features of these headphones was really more than I needed, but I was presently surprised how good they sounded. As I have found over the years with Bose, there was always a little problem in the mids, but the clarity was so clear it was a no-brainer. Ever since I’ve started using these I can’t get them off my ears. I started using them in place of my flat response headphones because they give me a good reflection of my monitors. they are extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time and the features are top-notch in the noise cancellation is about as good as it gets in a set of headphones. The volume control can be a little bit hard to get used to, but the more I use them the easier it gets, as usual. The one thing I don’t really care for and it’s being kind of picky is, I normally will use these with a wired connection in the studio to avoid any latency by using Bluetooth. But you have to have the headphones powered on even when wire direct. My other headphones don’t use any battery power when plugged in direct. Now, if you’re into high-tech, you’re going to love the immersive settings on these cans. I have no idea how they pull this off and it wasn’t the reason that I bought them in the first place, but these things are awesome. I guess there’s no way I can really explain how they work and what it sounds like so I guess you’ll have to buy a pair for yourself. The problem with that is that they are a little pricey as always with Bose, but I think in this case they’re worth it. I was prepared to send these back if they didn’t sound good, simply based on how much they cost , so I was pleasantly surprised and how good they were. If you can get by the price, you will be happy with these headphones. Nothing is perfect, that’s for sure, but in the audio department these things come pretty close….Nice job Bose !","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2024",AH2EV4FBMGFY4OCQTR2KGXU4YC4Q,True,25,Color: Black
R3IIWMZ9PUJU8I,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Everything is as they say, except for two things",Khang,4,"Everything with this headphones are as they say, going above sound quality comparing to the Sony XM5. ANC is great, don't be discouraged by reviews because it is only a little less of a difference between this and the XM5 with Sony's being slightly better. If there's a slight tug to decide whichever headphones to buy, go with the M4.My two personal experience with this headphones:First reason, there is a slight scratching noise when I listened, a couple of times on my left side. Not sure what's that about but it does sound like static/scratches for a few short duration. Online forums have noticed this as well.Second reason is my ONLY reason to write this review and inform others. My biggest reason of giving this review has to be when I received the item there seems to be a scratch on the left side of the plastic cover that is VERY hard to see unless lights hits it. It ran across almost a full width of the ear plastic/matte cover. It seems like the case has the audio cord metal plug facing outward and when closed, it may have reach in front of the ear covers during shipping and made contact with the headphones on accident.Mind you, I take extensive care for my tech products, because they are not cheap! No kids, no pets, and I put the headphones right back in its case after I'm done. It's barely been a week and less than a couple of hours. I was beyond excited to try these since I got the Limited Edition M4! Now it is quite disappointing and unsure after discovering the damage. I've tried wiping it with a microfiber towel and even going as far as using small dabs of soapy water in hope of removing the scratch, unfortunately nothing worked. I am going to return the item will be returned in hopes a new one isn't damaged upon arrival.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AEMA5VGRMIUBMSBQ3T3ZPJQG5K7A,True,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones

The touch controls are very sensitive so I occasionally trigger them accidentally, not too bad after some time of use. noise cancelling is good but they don’t filter conversations or human voices, the other day I was in a coffe. shop the background noise was gone but the conversation a table next tome was clearer so without music you can actually use them to listen to others people conversation. I have one main problem/complaint about them. For some reason they seem to be active all the time or they easily wake up, sometimes they are in my bag, where they were supposed to be sleeping but my iphone sends the sound through them, so constantly i have to change the sound source in my phone, its annoying. I don’t like that, sometimes when somebody calls me the caller cannot hear me because the headphones are connected (they were supposed to be sleeping) so I have to change the source in my phone. Also I will not recommend them if you want to listen your music at very high levels they don’t get very loud so sometimes when I want to crank up the volume for a part of a song I love, I cannot because they reached their maximum volume fast.

R3CBBVTHO6OEW6,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars I wanted to love these...,Joe,3,"I own another pair of Sennheiser headphones, the 598SE's, and they're spectacular. They're spacious, clear, wonderful sound stage, light, and powerful.After trying a few other brands of ANC headphones, I learned about the Momentum 4's and immediately thought: OK, Sennheiser is gonna knock it out of the park.Unfortunately, they only got to first base.First, the good:I love how these look, especially the copper accented special edition's that I got. The fabric on the top of the headband makes it look classy.The sound is wonderful. Absolutely the best thing about this product. The sound stage compared to the other major competitors is still a step above.The carrying case is nice, roughly the same size as their competitors. I did wish it could have been a bit smaller (this goes for the competitors too).The swipe controls are the same as a major competitor, which you can also lock. I really like the swipe controls, though having physical buttons would be nice too, especially if you lock the swipe controls.The battery life is beyond spectacular. It destroys their competition and you could probably wear these for several days without needing a charge.Now, the bad:They're quite heavy. The weight on paper seems like they'd be fine, but while wearing them I quickly got fatigued and felt frustrated wearing them (while their competitors, it took much longer to get to that point).They get hot. Not the headset itself, but they form a seal on your head and you'll feel your ears cooking after a short while in a comfortable temperature room. This was another reason I frequently took them off.The earcups are small. They seem EVER SO SLIGHTLY larger than their competitors but... not enough. The 598SE's have big beautiful spacious earcups but these (and their competitors) are very cramped.The ANC is notably weaker in a perfect environment without noise playing than others. With others, I could barely make out any words while playing a song or video rather loud as a test. With the Sennheisers I could make out quite a bit of words and sound. The Momentum 4's have fewer ANC microphones than the competitors.The ANC also almost drops out completely if you have ""windy environment mode"" turned on, for some reason. (Note: I did not test them in a windy environment) If the ANC is important, make sure you have this setting *TURNED OFF* in the app.The app is ok, but what you can ""control"" seems finicky and sometimes its as if changing settings did nothing.The call volume is like 5 generations ago hands-free headset. Very poor quality. The person I tested them with said it sounded like I was outdoors or in a noisy environment when I was in a quiet room.The clamping is quite tight and becomes painful very quickly. It puts a lot of pressure around your ear which can become very uncomfortable. A friend said they loosen up after a couple days but mine stayed far too tight. It felt like a vice. [If it doesnt bother you, this could be a plus, as they seem like they will hold their shape and tightness for a long time]Even lacking almost any physical buttons, they basically threaten you to not get these wet. There is no waterproofing on these. Handle with care.The rest:These are by no means a ""bad"" set of wireless ANC cans, and the price is good, especially if you can get them on sale. If you're just going to be using them in the office or on a commute, they'll probably be fine, especially if you dont want to dole out extra cash for a minor upgrade in ANC. The middling ANC was quite disappointing, but if you have some sounds playing while its on, it works together to make most noises disappear. Unfortunately, sometimes I want to be able to just block out the world, and the Momentum 4's were just not up to the task compared to others.I was really hoping the earcups would be larger and more similar to other Sennheiser headsets I've tried/owned, but they seemed to want to copy the competition, which is a shame. If the cups were larger and the clamping a bit less harsh, I would have accepted their flaws and gone with these. With the laundry list of negatives, you can probably tell why I didnt.Also please note: I am a big guy, and I probably have a larger than average head. This could be contributing to the clamping pressure.Listening to anything on these was a treat. Everything sounded beautiful. Other brands should take a few notes on Sennheisers drivers.I had two main requirements: comfortable ear cups (failed) and long battery life for an upcoming flight (wow did these pass with not flying colors but to outerspace and back colors!). Unfortunately, as they were just not at all comfortable (I could wear my 598SE's for days and not even realize they're there). Their long battery life did not offset the negatives.This may all not be true for you. They definitely stand out and are far more attractive than the competition (at least, the special edition versions are). I am definitely biased towards Sennheiser as I have loved so many of their headsets, but found these disappointing in far too many areas. A few design tweaks could have made these one of the best over the ear cans on the market. As is, they're probably ranked 4th imho.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2023",AHECMYUWUWYVG4EVIGA4QI6LUO4A,True,7,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones

RL3M28E80KTYV,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound quality, solid in every other area",Aaron,5,"Bought these along with the Sony XM5 to compare to my existing Bose 700.Comfort:The Bose 700 I don't find very comfortable, namely the headband, being rather thin, it puts pressure on the top of my head after a couple hours. The Sony had this problem initially, but then I started loosening the headband as much as possible, and being a very light pair, I stopped having that particular issue. All in all I found the Sony much more comfortable than the 700. I could see some folks saying it's more comfortable than the Momentum 4s. However I disagree about that. For me the Momentum 4 are the most comfortable. It has very soft ear pads, much like the Sony. Granted the M4s are heavier, but the weight is distributed very well across the headband, better than the Sony's imo. All in all, it's a close call and the Sony's are really well done comfort wise. Super light and super cushy pads. Could see a reasonable person going in either direction for the win here.Sound quality:I think the XM5 are pretty close to the Bose 700 and could see folks going either way depending on your signature preferences. Personally think I like the Sony a bit better, just more lively than the more neutral Bose. Both are in the same league though. The M4s are way better sound quality wise plain and simple. They're not in the same league. Heck, they're not even playing in the same sport. Find myself listening to music way more often during the day simply because I enjoy it that much more. This is the reason I'm ultimately sticking with the M4s. And it's not a hard decision.Noise cancelation:Sony XM5 are simply the best. If you're buying headphones to block out the sound of your partner playing annoying tiktok vids, this is the one to get. M4s have pretty good noise canceling too, but the Sony's are way better here imo. Bose sits between the XM5 and the M4s, maybe just a little better than the M4sMic sound quality:I'm work remotely with multiple meetings throughout the day so I've done extensive testing on all three models. In a nutshell if you don't have any special requirements, all of them do a great job. In quiet conditions I prefer the the M4 a little better than the others, my voice just has more body to it, but again, it's plenty clear using any of these models. In noisy conditions, the Sony XM5 are way better than the rest in isolating your voice and minimizing background noise. Simply incredible! The 700 and M4 handled the background noise a bit differently. My voice is clearer on the M4s in noisy conditions whereas the Bose cancel out more background noise at the cost of sacrificing clarity. When there's lots of noise, the Bose can reduce your voice to the point where it's super difficult to hear what you're saying. The M4s will allow more background noise through, but my voice remains super clear and louder than other sounds coming through.One feature I really like about the M4s, the one and only button they have (making it super easy to find) becomes a mute button during calls, zoom or google meetings. Really enjoy that feature as I could walk around the house and unmute myself if I need to talk. A voice tells you if it's muted or unmuted so you know where you're at. No more flushing the toilet while running out of the room hoping no-one on the meeting heard it.The background noise canceling of the XM5 during calls was so good, it made me really want to keep them. But ultimately good music sound quality is something I'd enjoy more often since I'm not often taking meetings in super noisy conditions. Also the M4s have the mute button I could use if I do find myself in that situation.Summery:If you want incredible noise cancelation while listening to music, taking calls or meetings, the Sony XM5 are the one to get. They are head and shoulders above the competition in this respect. If you wanna be wowed by how amazing your music sounds, renewing your love for music you didn't even know you had, the M4s are for you. These are the main areas where there is substantial difference. Sony and Seinheiser truly impressed me in their respective areas of expertise. Aside from those standout areas, these are all great headsets. Even the Bose 700 is a really solid headset. Unfortunately it wasn't able to differentiate itself when compared to these two titans of industry. Noise canceling is great, just can't touch the Sony's. Sound quality also great, just can't touch the M4s. Arguable the Bose are the slickest looking headset of the bunch though.","Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2022",AEIK33PCH7JB7R3OI4CZJZPPNLDQ,True,88,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R2PRHUA564H7O8,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound and comfort, annoying “quality of life”",Ash,3,"I wish I liked these headphones more.I bought these about a year ago for an international work trip which meant a lot of time on planes. The sound quality is fantastic. I appreciate the noise cancellation and the ability to turn it off when you’d like.The comfort of the headphones is pretty good, the cups fit around my ears perfectly not affecting my ear piercings. The band on top does get heavy after a while though.I love the battery life as well, these seemingly last forever without needing to worry about charging.However. I despise the touch controls on the side of the cup. I got these before the firmware upgrade where you could turn it off in app, which while I appreciate the ability to turn it off now it’s still infuriating. The slightest brush on the cup triggers the touch controls which affects whatever you’re listening to. If you’re relaxing, working, whatever, your shoulder will likely bump the side and then you have to restart your media. Not great if your hands are busy.I also just don’t like the fact that if I want my headphones to operate, I need to download and use an app to manage it. Maybe I’m a 20-something year old grandma, but I’d really like to be able to just turn on my headphones and go rather than loading up the app to turn off touch controls and whatever else I need set on them. This is because every time you turn the headphones on, it’s like Groundhog Day and you need to select the settings you want. You also apparently need a sennheiser account for sound personalization for your headphones, rather than being stored locally. I have the app already, it needs to communicate with the app for firmware upgrades and settings changes, just store it locally.These headphones also have a terrible habit of turning on when you store them in their case. The edge of the case presses against the power button location. I have turned these on unintentionally many times while putting them away. Those touch controls reset every time they’re power cycled too, so your backpack can start singing to itself.Now that I’ve had these for a year, I can say I don’t really reach for these as much as I wanted to. These were intended to replace some very old Bose sound sport earbuds and I honestly do not use these as much as I did those. It’s just too much of a process to deal with every time I want to use them, without affecting my quality of listening experience.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2024",AEH7NVF2ONKWTYCWIKAN62TMFVZA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

I don't think any bluetooth ANC headphones will ever match that experience, but Sennheiser comes closer than any I've yet heard. It meets my needs.The noise cancellation is much stronger than my old $120 Sony headphones, and the battery lasts roughly three times as long -- upwards of 60 hours. The audio pass-through feature is also great for those times when you need to listen to your surroundings.I enjoy the style as well. The white/beige color stands out among bluetooth headphones, I think.I've only two complaints: 1) My head is on the larger size, and these are a tight fit. They do break in after awhile (I'm posting this after around 9 months of use), but they still clamp a bit too hard for my liking, and can run hot. Should not be a problem for most people, I think. But for larger headed folks, be aware of what you're getting into. I'm willing to make the compromise for headphones of this quality, though. 2) the headphones have the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously, but I find this feature isn't worthwhile. When I'm listening to music through my tablet, and I get a text alert from my phone, there's a staticky sound that just makes it not worth using. That said, I haven't had the other software issues that some users experience. As far as I can tell, Sennheiser has patched it all up -- my experience has been smooth.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AH2PJ2BKE72VH5SVUL7TI6ZMXXXA,True,1,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

Safe to say, they aren't the most noise canceling headphones you can get. So when I went looking for a new pair of wireless over-ears, I had a lot to choose from. I didn’t want sony so that was out of the question.I had whittled it down to four pairs.AirPods MaxBose Quietcomfort UltraSennheiser Momentum 4’s andSonos Ace.Now each of these had their own strengths and weaknesses.AirPods Max are realistically only compatible with apple products and have the worst battery life. However have the same sound signature as my current AirPods.Bose Quietcomfort Ultra has the best noise canceling of the bunch, but was more expensive and ultimately poor battery life.Sonos Ace is the newest one of the bunch, it has decent audio quality and an okay battery. The worst was the microphone, I did not want to have to deal with a microphone that low quality.Which brings me to the ones I went with.Momentum 4 has some of the best soundstage I’ve heard in headphones. The bass is punchy but doesn’t muddy the rest of the track. The touch controls are personally a hit or miss, I love most of them but wish I could pinch or un-pinch to turn transparency fully on or off respectively.

The picture shows comparison with sony 720n. I tried Sony ULT wear (too bassy), Beats Pro (too flat sound signature), Sennheiser Accentum (good but sound quality wasnt best), Sony WH 1000 XM4 (instrument separation wasnt bes). I have Airpods pro 2 but I also wanted a headset as the sound staging of headset is better.Let me address all the cons that you might have heard from youtube influencers. All the cons like headset automatically powering on while in case, auto pause not working etc are gone with latest software update (Software rev 2.13.28)Pros:The sound of Sennheiser momentum 4 is clean with impressive instrument separation and bass that both hits and resonates.

I keep them around 70% as I dont want to miss out on all of that intstrument separation!the case, although bigger than sony ULT wear/1000xm4 and bose QC but its not as big as sony 1000 xm5 or other headset that dont fold.

I cant hear my keystrokes when I am typing, no hum of AC in the background (my home office is very close to AC unit). Touch controls are bit sensitive but its not bad. You get used to it.I purchased them at $280. So its a steal. I would not buy them at $379. They dont feel premium enough to justify $379 price tag. They do live up to $280 price tag. Not super premium, but not cheap looking by any means.60 hours battery life!The clamping force isnt as tight as its on other Sennheiser headsets like 450 BT or Accentum. Its bit tighter as compared to Sony WH 720 n though.

The immersion is also better.I actually meant to just do a quick test listen of the Momentum 4 after I received them, but that test listen turned into hours of listening, as I couldn’t seem to take them off.

I purposely bought the white model - very clean/modern look, but perhaps a little too minimalistic. Also looks like many other competing wireless headphones ><.2. A little on the small side. I have fairly average-sized ears, and the earcups barely cover the lobes, which is great for passive noise cancellation, but I did have to adjust the headband quite a bit. In comparison, the Airpods have a self-adjusting system similar to my wired AKG K712 i.e., the headband will adjust to your head size.3. Plasticky compared to the Apple's metal frame. It's kind of like my AKG vs. my Beyerdynamic. In terms of build quality feel, 'you get what you pay for'.Comfort:1. Earpads: this is what most travelers will care about. Like with any headphone, I adamantly recommend everyone review manufacturer site, legitimate review sites, etc. The Sennheiser M4 has pleather pads as you can tell. No need to say that they'll get hot after a while - common knowledge. Grado loses here for obvious reasons, then the Sennheiser, then the Beyerdynamic, and finally the winner the Airpods. Apple was smart in using mesh - breathable and lightweight.2. Headband: this is not as big a deal as earpads. None of the test headphones were terrible, but some were still better than others. The Sennheiser uses a medium with pleather band covered by fabric, which looks nice. In a huge switcheroo, Grado wins with their thin industrial band, followed by Apple's thin metal, then the Sennheiser, and finally the Beyerdynamic with their high-end but a little too thick leather curve.Sound and Noise cancellation:1. Obviously, a wired headphone connected to a top end USB DAC will beat any wireless one, but both the Apple and Sennheiser did well here. And they still cost less than the Beyerdynamic to boot.2. Neither wired headphones are noise cancelling nor do they claim to be, but being semi-closed/open, you would think the Beyerdynamic might do ok, but no joy.3. Both the Apple and Sennheiser are very good at noise cancellation, but not perfect, but the Apple was clearly better, even with all Sennheiser settings at max.Accessories:1. This is a fun one. Apple being Apple, gives you jack (no pun intended). An USB C to Lightning cable, infamous bra case.2. Sennheiser, meanwhile, gives you an outdated (haven't seen these in years) airplane double connector, 2.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable, USB C to A cable, and finally a nice cloth case (my color combo was gray).3. Additional note: wired headphones, being wired, both the Grado and Beyerdynamic gave 3.5mm to 6.3mm audio adapters. Being a high-end model, the T1 also came with a case.Final thoughts:1. I normally don't use wireless headphones, at most, a Bluetooth amp, the aforementioned USB DAC and one of my usual wired cans. But my brother convinced my to try a pair for an upcoming trip. They really are convenient.2. The unfortunate thing I found in my search, as of this writing (9/30/2022), there are no modern (i.e., BT 5) really high-end e.g., T1 level wireless headphones out there. They all seem to top out around the $400 mark, which sounds a lot, but not for a ultra high end wired headphone.3. Of the 10 or so better choices out there, what I would recommend depends on your music style, phone, use/need. Loyal Apple users - Airpods Max, Android users - this Sennheiser M4, hardcore must have the best music quality users - wait - niche uber manufacturers are getting there.","Reviewed in the United States September 30, 2022",AFZQEWUCJEY5NLQE6XQY3QQ5WC3Q,True,36,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RQIJ8796C2B2A,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser Sound is top notch,NerdyCup,4,"TLDR; great sound with pretty good ANC.First, I'm not an audiophile. I appreciate music and sound more than just ""MOAR BASS"" but as to warmth, tonality, and terms like that, I'm lost. I do know having worn open back headphones those have a great sound space compared to closed back, but my wife can't stand hearing my music so it's closed back headphones for me.Positive:1. Great sound. Between these, some Senns 598s, true momentum earbuds, I've never not liked the sound Sennheiser produces. Earbuds were the weakest, but those were Momentum 2s and didn't last long when my dogs chewed on them (I understand Sennheiser has improved as well).1A. I cannot understate how good these sound - I literally can hear Chester Bennington pushing his breath out on ""Lost"", and instruments I've never picked up before. I can't recall other headsets doing that for me.2. Comfortable - immediately comfortable out of the box. Maybe warms up my ears a bit much, but the benefit is a solidly closed ""box"" for my ears to listen without distraction.3. Battery life appears to be as epic as they say it is. I haven't rocked it solid for 50+ hours to find out but I've charged it like once, when I first got it a few weeks ago (not constantly listening)Unknowns: need to test the ANC on an airplane/airport setting, which is my biggest pet peeve for noise environments. Will try to update (if I remember) once I do.Negatives:1. Touch controls in general. It's not just Sennheiser, but Sony and others im sure. I just don't really want to take the time to remember if it's a swipe, pinch, double-triple-quad tap to do something. KISS should be the rule of thumb. I can stumble through by tapping/swiping either side and eventually find something close to what I want, but I usually end up in the Sennheiser Smart Control App to make sure the ANC is what I want.Comparison:I also got a Sony WH-1000XM5 recently. Also a very good headphone, but the sound is absolutely not as good as Sennheiser. ANC is top of class though (although I also have t tried it in an airport/airplane, just in my commutes), and is better than Sennheiser, it's not as huge a gap as it used to be. We're comparing a Porsche and a BMW; should anyone turn either of them down? No.It comes down to your personal needs: lots of travel(air, train, whatever) in noisy environments? Maybe go with Sony, but I'd try the Sennheiser Momentum 4s first to see if their ANC works for you. IMO, the Sennheiser sound quality is much better than Sony's sound more than Sony's ANC is better than Sennheiser's.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024",AGX5BT3OBJ4RMSQM7TVVOBQTPU4Q,True,4,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones

R3V8FW19HBYSG7,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Don't touch them or they'll try to connect to everything,Customer Since 1997,3,"These headphones must have some kind of tilt sensor or other mechanism to know when they have been moved. If I am not using them and I accidentally touch them or they get bumped and move even slightly, they will suddenly try to connect to every device they are paired with, cutting off the sound from a random device I'm not currently using them with. They also seem to just randomly connect themselves to any device that is playing audio, cutting off the sound so that I have to go to that Bluetooth device's settings and disconnect them to get sound back. Very annoying.That aside, these are what I would call 'average' headphones. They're your typical V-shaped consumer sound that you'd get from any other dynamic headphone. They're bass heavy because your average consumer equates more base with more quality.Their noise cancellation is not particularly good. They seem to slightly lower the volume of some noises. In the areas where other noise canceling headphones excel such as repetitive or droning noises, these headphones seem to not work at all. For example, when I'm a passenger in a car I can clearly hear the noise of the air conditioner with the noise cancellation maxed out.There's also a problem with the touch surface on the earcup. I have turned off the touch features several times but they keep turning themselves back on. Every time I touch my face to scratch an itch or brush my hair out of my face I hear a PLOK and a random setting on the headphones has changed itself as if I have interacted with them. I have to dig my phone out in the middle of my exercise, figure out which setting was changed, and change it back.That's not to say that these headphones are all bad: I have tried many of the headphones in the ""fancy wireless headphones with noise canceling"" category over the years, and I'd have to say that in terms of comfort, these are the best. I can wear them for hours while exercising with minimal discomfort.That said, they do have some rattling and creaking issues that I would not expect at this price point. There's an unusual amount of plastic material on these headphones that I would not expect on a premium noise canceling headphone. While other brands are using lovely brushed aluminum supports for the earcups, these headphones have stuck with the creaky plastic with clearly visible mold lines.To summarize, I would say that these headphones are sort of the odd person out: They do not excel at anything, but they are not particularly bad at anything, either. Senheiser seems to have targeted to produce a headphone that provides middle-of-the-road performance in all areas, and in that capacity they have succeeded.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AER3H6YXKFEFRVUVRRMSWOQFE42A,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3IPWB05P9IKRT,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best All Over Ear Headphones,Customer Ed,5,"I’ve tried many over ear and in ear headphones, including the Sony WH-1000xm4 and xm5, apple AirPods Max, and other Sennheisers. Simply put, these are the best. These have enhanced my enthusiasm for listening to new music, and I love listening to old favorites with all the luxurious, crisp detail these headphones can reproduce. I’ve broken it down into the most important features to me:Sound Quality: I’m not audiophile, but I can say these sound far superior to any of the other over ears I’ve used. Sennheiser is known for its neutral, accurate sound, and these seem to be the best iteration of that sound. Soundstage is wide open with incredible spatial effects, instrument separation, and no notable coloration or boxy sound. Despite the clarity, the bass here is incredible. You can feel it, but in a natural way that really underpins the song. Strong, natural base and incredibly detailed throughout the frequency spectrum, I can’t wait to get these things on my ears all day long. Just a pure joy of a listening experience.ANC - very strong. Not quite as strong as the Sony, but not enough of a drop down. You won’t notice much of a difference between these and any of the “better” ANC headphones. Same goes for the transparency mode, which allows you to hear ambient noise when you switch it on.Battery life - 60 hours is insane, but in my experience I’m getting that with ANC on so the claims don’t seem to be exaggerated.Comfort: definitely a little heavier than my Sonys, but buttery smooth headband and even weight distribution make for comfortable, long listening sessions. May be a bit of adjustment period if you’re used to lighter cans, but certainly not as heavy as the AirPods Max.Touch controls: definitely take some getting used to at first. Double tap right ear cup to enable ANC or transparency, pinch in or out to change noise cancellation level (this control is wonky and very hard to use, so I just use adaptive ANC and let it do its thing). Tracks can be switched by swiping left or right, but this can be an adventure. Depending on the angle that they’re sitting on your head, it can be hard to swipe in the exact right direction. With some practice it gets better. Same goes for up and down for volume, and volume changes seem to occur depending on the length of your swipe, rather than in steady increments. This means getting it to your exact desired volume using touch controls can be difficult. Answering and ending calls is also done through swiping forward and back, so you can experience the same issues. Overall, not the most intuitive controls, but not a deal breaker and with time it becomes easier.Call quality: I keep these on while working and take phone calls. Through some testing, these provide much better voice pickup and clarity than any of my in ears or even the built in speaker phone. If I’ve got an important call, I know the person on the other line will hear every word if I’m using these. Switching between calls, music, and podcasts with these all day long, these are perfect. They also have multipoint connectivity, providing seamless switching between laptop and phone.Overall, these are the best over ears I’ve found for what I use them for. Music, podcasts, commuting, movies and tv shows, work calls. The highest praise I have for these is they have revived my love of music as they remind you how good music can sound when reproduced with clarity and detail.If you’ve got some deep pockets, I’d also pick up the Momentum true wireless 3 earbuds, to have that same beautiful sound during those times that full over ear headphones aren’t appropriate.","Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2022",AGORAFANRG5DE6BQM4JS3ZO3EAQA,True,48,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

This review is about the overall experience. Note: I happen to LOVE the way these look, simple, plain, understated... smaller target for theft, too.I have the Sennheiser HD 515, HD 598, and HD 598 Cs, and the Sennheiser GAME ONE headset.

I know that, and need that, because I used to play World of Warcraft for about 50 hours a week, with headphones all the time.First impression—the cups are smaller. It just so happens that I have normal ears, and the other Sennheisers I have are too big for me, with a good margin to adjust them when the skin gets tired around my earlobes. The MOMENTUM 4 surprised me by being smaller, but—they have a really good design and are concave, with more space inside the cup than it seems, especially in the back. I am able to find a few different positions where my earlobes are not pressed (or even touched) at all, but how they fit you will depend on your ears, which is something important to consider.The review at SoundGuys is on point. The M4 do have a bit more low end than my other sets, and I like that; it's easier to EQ your way down than up. Overall very happy with the sound, I don't think you'd be disappointed. As the SG review says, the ANC is a little weak sometimes; I don't care, to me that's secondary.Battery life is amazing, the 60hrs claim seems accurate. Build quality is plasticky and okay, I would baby them a bit. Touch controls are precise and responsive for me, even with the guide stickers still on the outside (which I've removed after my wife made fun of me for it). The app seems to work all right, I think it's better to set your preferences and then not use it anymore, as sometimes the settings get changed around a bit for no reason. (KEEP UP WITH FIRMWARE UPDATES, though.)Connectivity—outstanding. Bluetooth (multipoint x2), passive mode, and USB mode. Quickly: * Bluetooth: works fine. Good range, it seems. I don't care for or like the multipoint, and I think it's irrelevant. * USB mode: use USB-A to USB Type C cable (included). Headphone presents as a regular USB headset to the computer. Works great and charges at the same time. * Passive mode: Uses a 3.5mm to 2.5mm cable (included) to use as a plain Jane wired headset. You CAN power on the M4 in this mode and benefit from better sound, or leave them off (on purpose, or if the battery is dead). I DISAGREE THAT THE SOUND IS BAD IN PURE PASSIVE MODE, WITH POWER OFF. It's slightly subpar compared to BT/USB/powered passive, but it's JUST FINE, and pretty good to boot.The SG review docks the M4 on mic quality, but in my tests people's feedback was that the calls were clear and noise-free, even when I was doing yard work on a very windy day. Still, YMMV.Case—it's a carrying case. It's... functional, plain, the way I like my coffee.My only complaint, if this tells you anything—the charge port and 2.5mm port are on the RIGHT cup, whereas all other sets I've ever had or seen have the cable going to the LEFT one. The power button and touch controls are also on the RIGHT, so maybe that's why, but on the (infrequent) occasions when you may have a cable attached, it's not where you'd be used to finding it.","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2023",AGORTA25R56MRPEW236JMI3XD25Q,True,112,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

Firstly, the connection gets choppy sometimes, and I don't know why. It often requires restarting the headset to fix. Another issue is that the quietest volume is not quiet enough. Listening to music in bed at night, it's just too loud in such an otherwise quiet environment. Also the auto-off/wake feature is way too sensitive. I'll leave it on my desk, come back later, and just bumping the desk makes it turn back on which often I don't want. Also if I manually disconnect the headset BT connection from my phone, the headset will just reconnect after a few seconds which is really annoying.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AEL3ADX56NWIHHUCZKWI7N6FDU5Q,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3HDZ4YGKNQ6L5,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable + Great Sound + Connection Problems + Poor touch controls,Ryan,3,"I just got these headphone. I really like how they feel and sound. The problem I have with these headphones is largely related to its bluetooth features and controls. I have these headphones connected to my phone and my TV. I live in an apartment. As such, these headphones constantly get confused between which bluetooth source to connect to. The result is choppy, broken audio or no audio at all and problems with touch controls.When its my phone's audio that's choppy the solution is to disconnect the tv using the headphone app. However, shortly after disconnecting the tv, the tv reconnects on its own and the problem returns. When its the TV audio that choppy, I have to turn off bluetooth on my phone completely to solve the problem. This again is due to the headphones automatically connecting to the unwanted source.The controls for this headphone are wonky to say the least and often don't work. For example, I will answer a phone call with a touch control but then can't end the phone call with a touch control. Another example is that I can't start or resume playing Spotify on my phone using touch controls. But while the music is playing I can pause, skip, or change the volume. I think some of these problems may be due to the headphones connecting to my tv at the same time. I suspect that my attempts to play or resume music are being sent to my TV (which is off) and not to my phone.The headphone's app is largely useless for attempting to solve these problems. The likely solution to all of these problems is to 'forget' my tv. Meaning, everytime I want to connect my headphones to my tv I would have to pair them with my tv. At this point, I'm likely to return these headphones due to all of these problems.To put all of the above in perspective. I have a pair of Pixel earbuds and I experience none of the above problems.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AF4KKUJCDDGW4ZZLQN23QJMOYFCQ,True,1,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones
R2T613ZGHLVDMA,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great Battery. Decent sound. Bad connectivity, ANC, and touch controls.",KD,3,"Like clockwork, my Studio3 Beats broke a few months past the warranty. I was looking to replace them with something more reliable overall. After reading the reviews, I took a chance on the Momentum 4s. These headphones performed exactly how the reviews stated. When they worked it was great, but after a day or two I started experiencing connectivity issues and the touch controls randomly activating. I would be on a call and it would randomly mute or disconnect, without anything touching the headset at all. While listening to music, the volume and skip buttons wouldn't respond at times. After a quick reboot, they would work for a little while, before intermittently failing again. The best thing about the Momentum 4s is the battery life. I was able to go a few days before needing to charge them. The transition between ANC and the Transparency mode was fairly decent when left on auto, but was a bit buggy when trying to use the touch controls. If you are lucky enough to get a pair without most of these issues, this would be a great purchase. While debating on getting a replacement or returning them, the left ear started to make a loud static noise that overtook any audio that was coming through. I decided to return them and will continue looking. Good luck if you decide to make this purchase.","Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2024",AGFRLJSPG5JD7RT2ZK7YJXLY6KWA,True,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones
ROYKDE0H8KYE6,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite wireless headphones,mariah kemmerer,5,"You can use them while charging - all other arguments are obsolete.Lol but no seriously, not only do these have a crazy long battery life you can also use them while they are plugged in charging. I'm a simple woman with simple needs, but even the Sony M5 can't do that.I had been debating between these and the Sony 1000XM5 and had even purchased the M5. But I had to immediately return them. I'm not sure what it is with Sony and their terrible sizing. They were just too big and loose. Thankfully, Sennheiser has never disappointed and the fit of the Momentum 4 is great. As a general consumer (not a self-proclaimed audiophile) I found these very comparable in build and material to the Sony M5.Coming from always wearing open-back Sennheisers there is a drop in sound quality, but (!) that is expected and I don't find that a detractor. They still sound great. I think the Sony M5 had a bit more of a clearer sound, and the Momentum 4 has a bit too much bass out of the box - but with a little tweaking in the Sennheiser app, I found a happy spot. Noise-canceling is good - I wouldn't say top of its class, but I haven't found myself ever thinking ""gee, I wish they blocked out more noise."" And once I turn on music or a video I don't notice any background noise even in busy places.The mic is okay. I don't really use it, so it's not on my priority list - but if it is for you the Sony M5 outclasses these by a mile on mic quality.The Bluetooth connection works well for me and has a good range. But there can be some drawbacks if you're switching between more than 2 devices regularly. Between my iPad and iPhone, these headphones connect great, and audio will bounce back and forth between them pretty seamlessly. When only 2 devices are connected, they will always be connected and you don't have to do anything to switch between them. BUT once you add a third device you have to start regularly opening the app. You MUST have the app. Because I connected my iPad and phone first, after the headphones get turned on it will auto-connect to those 2 devices (regardless of what it was last connected to). When I first connected these headphones to my computer I couldn't understand why there was no audio and the sound settings were stuck on mute. Fun fact - you have to go into the app and open up the connection manager and toggle on the device you want to use. Only two devices can be toggled on at once. I have to do this every time I want to use these with my computer - because as I said it will revert to my iPad and phone automatically. Not a dealbreaker - but a pain in the ass.Touch controls. I don't hate them. I had a pair of older Bluetooth Sony's with touch controls and absolutely hated them. Bane of my existance. But I find these controls a lot better thought out and executed. I don't accidentally hit them and once I fiddled with the control options in the app (you can customize what some touches do) I really like being able to double-tap between ambient and noise canceling.Overall I really like these headphones and am very happy I returned the Sony M5 and grabbed these.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2022",AHMZTM2ZRR7O2HALQIPM7OE2UQUA,True,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

The Momentum 4 checks all the boxes.Battery life is insane. Once charging cord (finally) is great. ANC is solid; no uncomfortable pressure or buzzing; and I took a flight while barely realizing we were on one.The folding and durability is nice and can easily carry these in a backpack with many other items. Extremely comfortable even for an 8hr session (and I wear glasses).I am far from an audiophile, but I have zero complaints about sound quality for calls, music, games, and movies. The in-app EQ is a good option. Mic quality is solid and have received zero complaints even on external customer calls.I was not expecting to like the touch controls. I do wish they were physical buttons, customizable, and on both earcups instead of just the right hand one. However, the actual experience (swipe up/down for volume, left/right for tracks, and tap to pause) is solid, with very few accidently presses. On-head detection worked perfectly. The physical button on the headset being a mute button while on a call is amazing, and this is detected in software on mobile (example being discord) and on desktop (WebEx mutes and unmutes itself in software when I press the button on the headset). This is amazing.The Multipoint connection (android phone and windows laptop) is very solid; notifications on the phone don't steal audio from a work call or vice versa. I do wish the headphone jack was a normal 3.5mm one instead of a smaller plug on the headset, then I wouldn't have to keep track of the adapter cord. Minor issue; very glad there is still a physical cable option along with the USB-C charging.Overall, this was the headset I was looking for and expect to run it for years.","Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2024",AHXNPP7TG2E73FWLT7L7PDVSH4XA,True,0,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

RTN9WQR625T86,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars What you need to know...,Randall Whitted,5,"Before buying these, you gotta know some things. First, if you listen to earbuds a lot, over-ear headphones sound different. The sound is less directly in your ear, and more around you. As such, there is less impact. That doesn't mean these aren't good, they're just not shoved into your ear.Second, the source makes or breaks these. A crappy source will sound crappy on these and you'll end up blaming the headphones. It's actually a feature of the headphones though. They reproduce what you put into them very well. Go into Spotify and mess with the EQ there if you feel the need. I like sharp treble and got it that way. Change the stream setting to highest quality. Plug them into a good digital to analog converter (DAC). Try different sources and you'll see whatever you may not be liking is not the headphones. As an acoustic guitarist, I was hoping for the same sound I get with my Martin on my lap. I'd love to have headphones that sound like Tony Rice and Dave Grisman are standing on either side of me, but that's not gonna happen. Again, the source matters. These headphones are not a hand-built American acoustic guitar played by a master standing next to you, but they'll sound more like it than the majority of headphones.Third, we've become programmed to in-your-face sound. These Momentum 4 are very much ""grown-up"" headphones. They articulate. They detail. The present. But they don't floor you with over-the-top sound all through the range. There are plenty of good, inexpensive headphones and earbuds that will pop your eardrums. I personally recommend Anker for that. My Space A40 earbuds are awesome, but when I A/B tested the A40 and these Momentum 4, I realized there were instruments I didn't even realize were there when listening with the A40 earbuds.Fourth, the bluetooth is dumb at first. From what I can tell, they won't work like you'd expect until you launch the app as part of the connection process. It's fine though. Just don't give up on them right off the bat because of that.Other random thoughts - they're super UNcomfortable right away, become very comfortable rather quickly - like within minutes. Also, good headphones do have a break-in period, and these are no exception. Be sure to try the wired connection on some different sources as well. MacBooks have good DACs in them. Anker makes a good USB-C to aux adapter with a DAC in it. The bluetooth connection can sound pretty dang good though. And the microphones in this headset are almost creepy-good. Also, bluetooth range is perfectly fine. I went three rooms away in my house with no issues at all.Summary - I was thinking of returning these, but I know Sennheiser so I messed with settings and connections and I'm glad I did. They're great headphones, but the key is to remember - if your source is crap, they will faithfully reproduce that crap.","Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2023",AEJWET4WAUKOAUJKFYEZSZKWTTNA,True,104,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R2DR9OKGN9HSJV,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Wired Mode is sometimes totally bugged. Manufacturer defect.,Amazon Customer,3,"I got this pair about a month ago, and when i got it out of the box to explore the features, I noticed some serious issues; the bluetooth latency is terrible for gaming, and in wired mode (to reduce latency), sometimes the sound is ruined.I'm a gamer, and I like to play a lot of PUBG, so I need great sound, AND I need low sound latency, I noticed that in bluetooth mode, the latency is just too high. Like ~100 ms high. Maybe this can be improved to like 40 ms with the right bluetooth controller, but I really want ~5 ms.When I first got it, and I tried to use wired mode (and stumbled upon the 2.5mm jack, had to buy new cables. Wtf is wrong with you. >:C), the sound quality was trashed. I don't mean ""bad"" like some picky audiophile. I mean TRASHED. I can hardly describe how bad it is, it's like the volume is dropped by 30 db, and for some reason only a few narrow bands of frequency manage to make it through, making some noises come through orders of magnitude louder than others. It's just this unlistenable murky mess. No exaggerationThis problem persisted for like 3 days, and it all of a sudden went away for no reason. It worked just fine for a whole month, (and I adored the sound quality) and now the problem has come back for no reason. What the hell is this? I noticed that if I back out the jack on my DAC by ~1/16 inch, I get decent sound quality IN MONO. Unacceptable. Factory resetting the headphones did nothing. A firmware update did nothing. Restarting my computer? nothing. Shutting off all bluetooth? Nothing.The other features are fine. Maybe I felt like the bass was comparatively weak to my old bassy cans, but I got used to it.","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2024",AGGGNM37DWTLZE7UPYKWPFJCCBCQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

The app certainly didn't let me dial things in, which may have been why things didn't sound amazing. Overall, it was just okay.So, what's not great? The app on Android is awful, the headphones would sometimes cut out to a loud static, or pick up RF interference, and the touch controls are awful and easily activated by tilting your head. Also, there's no ""Lossless"" option for hi-res audio and you need a separate dongle to use on your PC (and still can't use it as a gaming headset without it stepping down to AM radio quality I/O).Once the new Bluetooth codec standards for lossless 16-bit / 44.1kHz come out, and once you can pair to networks and some of the new protocols coming out in the next few years, I would be curious to see if Sennheiser revises this and fixes the issues I've mentioned.It's very close, but it's just not worth the asking price.

I really like the look as well. I purchased them in white. After receiving them I quickly downloaded the app and got stated. As many have said, the app isn’t always great. Sometimes, it doesn’t connect properly and it really annoying. I am not an audiophile or a tech person but these sound great. I use the podcast setting constantly. Music sounds pretty amazing. I also love the intuitive touch controls. I looked at the manual online and watched a ton of videos to make sure I was optimizing the features. They are pretty comfortable. The ear cups actually don’t bother me when I have earrings in or glasses on which is great. The headpiece is very soft and luxurious feeling. The automatic pause and restart is awesome when it works. Then only issue with this is that if I take them off and lay them down and do not turn them off, when you go to play something Bluetooth’d to another device, it’s will often just play on you headphones that are laying down somewhere no not on your head. The ANC is just ok. I bought these because I stupidly knocked my Bose off of my head while cleaning the pool. They still work after much drying but they don’t last long on the charge. These are nowhere near the ANC of the Bose or even AirPod Pros. I have not used the SONYs so I cannot compare those. However, I am fine with them being just ok in this feature as I use them outside to walk and run and kind of would like to be able to hear what’s going on around me without having full traffic noise. Here are my issues…..first off, every phone call that comes in, when I answer it with headphones on….it immediately disconnects the call. It works fine if I call out. I have noticed this is a problem as evidenced on messages boards but there doesn’t really seem to be much of a solution. I contacted the company to see if they. Had a solution. Their response? Just return them to Amazon, as they have a better return policy in the Sennheiser Amazon store. The return policy is 30 days. Mind you….I purchased them March 24, and my original email was sent March 29. Today is April 24. Thus, leaving me no time to return them (I DID tell them in my email when I purchased them). I asked two questions and they didn’t address the one above at all. Really unhappy with the customer service for a $300 product.

I had a few Sennheiser headsets over the years, and this one is major disappointment. I bought it because PXC550 was aging and I always wanted to buy momentum, because it was considered higher product line.1. Design - it is step back from original Momentum. If I wanted Sony I could buy Sony. I bought this headset because I like the brand, but design...why not copy iPods? Dumb.2. Comfort- clamping action is much stronger then PXC550 or Sony XM5(tried in store). Pads relatively hard and ears sometimes do not fit well.3. Controls - BAD, really BAD, DID I mention that they are BAD? I am comparing them to old model of PXC550.On/OFF functionality - why not to keep same function when cups are flat headset is off when turned in listening position headset is ON. With this headset you never know if the are on or off. Reviewers say ""it is not a problem because headset has large battery life"" - this is most dumb excuse you can come up with.Tap to Play/Pause - some times it works some times it does does not. You never know what will happen, will play, will it stop, will it turn off ANC?Volume Up/Down- no audible feed back when you raising or lowering the volume using headset and no immediate reaction. Why not to keep same functionality as on older headsets each volume change would respond with the sound.ANC- What ANC? most reviewers say it is slightly worse then Sony ... they are lying it is pretty much worse then anything I had, including $30 Chinese junk. This gesture adjustment does not really work, double tap sometimes work some times does not. On maximum ANC I still hear voices and passing cars. However it does cancel the wind which is good.4. Sound - Ok sound is not really bad. It is well balanced and has just a few more details then other headsets I tried Not within same price range, but within same consumer class I could hear background singer on one of the songs. It is louder then PXC550 which is good, but balance and detail is pretty much the same. This headset has no Stage at all. Sound lucking ""WOW"" feeling, it is pretty flat.I noticed this headsets has random disconnects. not really bad, but still worth to mention.I am still thinking about returning it, or keep it for few more days to see if they grow on me.I would say price (250) is pretty good for what you get.if you never had anything better it would be good headset for the money.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2024",AGFPE3TGGCHH7S4DE5Z7HZ7ZCAUA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R1OLFI88OUFMZ9,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Best in class!,Shelby Yale Marr,5,"I went to BestBuy to get my hands on a few of the top contenders. Sony XM5, Bose 700, and a few others not worth mentioning. They did not have a Sennheiser momentum 4 in the store for demo, they had to be ordered. The battery life of the Sony and the Bose were better than the others they had available in store. The sound quality was good. The materials felt cheap some more than others. I did not care for the skinny headband on some of them. After trying them out, I went on Amazon’s website and ordered the Sennheiser momentum 4. The 60 hour battery life, and fast charging is amazing. The noise canceling is excellent, I work with a lot of heavy equipment, it is loud all the time. I have used them on several long flights for both music from my phone or my tablet, or the airplanes movie selection. Several of the flights had very loud and obnoxious children, the noise canceling and good volume level made it much more pleasant. The build quality of the Sennheiser momentum 4 feels much more premium than the Sony or the Bose. The sound quality and clarity is unmatched to anything that I have tried, as far as wireless headphones. The frequency response is incredible with the 42 mm drivers. The gesture controls are intuitive, and very easy to use and get used to. I can wear them for hours my head does not get tired or sore. Everyone that I have come across that has tried them wants to set for themselves. Using them at work I often have multiple phone calls, there are gestures you can use on the side control to swap between calls. The microphones built into the headset pick up your voice clearly and eliminate background noise and wind for very clear calls. They are great for short sessions, but also long sessions as I have worn them for over 12 hours in a row. I wear glasses and they do not bother me while wearing glasses. I have had them for nearly a year. The battery life is still very strong. You can go on vacation and not have to charge the headphones until you return. I had a pair of Brookstone noise, canceling headphones years ago. When they eventually failed, I picked up a pair of Sony noise, canceling headphones. The Sony’s eventually failed as well. I replaced them with Bose they were wired the wire deteriorated very rapidly. Replaced them with a set of Bose earbuds, they are handy, but for a long flight the Sennheiser’s are definitely the way to go. Amazing sound quality. Transparency mode is also a very handy feature. Double tap the side of the headphone to activate or deactivate transparency mode so you can hear what is going on around you. The ability to lift the ear cup to pause playback is very handy. They also power down when you place them in the very nice case.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2023",AGXNT7BE4PKZY7LPRQ5IMFXHPLTQ,True,19,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R2UYH59HBOTDSC,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent pair of headphones,Tyler,4,"I already had plans to buy these but after my Sennheiser CX wireless earbuds took a tumble in the washer, I kinda had to get these. I was already aware of the numerous issues that people had with these headphones but after having these for 2 weeks, I never ran into any of them.First Impression- Overall really like the look of these with the fabric headband and an all-around clean look. A little plasticky feeling but it isn't the kind of cheap plastic you would find on inexpensive headphones.Sound Quality- Now I'm not a big headphone person or audiophile guy but to me, these sound great and are probably one of the best-sounding over-ear wireless headphones I've ever owned. Super clear sound and very good bass.Call Quality- Mic is what you’d expect. Not the best but it's good enough for calls. I was able to hear clearly from people on the other end and they heard me on the other end perfectly fine. Side-Tone works great too however I don't like hearing myself so I keep it off.ANC-It really isn't that bad, although it doesn't match the quality that Sony headphones have, it's enough to water out most sounds around you however lower frequencies tend to pass through.App and Controls-The app is super easy to navigate through with a lot of settings to choose from. One of these settings would be an equalizer so you can mess around and find your own preferred sound configuration. Touch controls definitely took some time to get used to but they are very reactive to touch and I don't think you’ll need to do any double tapping. You can also disable touch controls if you don't like them. To address pairing issues, I had absolutely none. Might be different for you since I do still see these complaints every now and then.Comfort-Comfort is something that comes down to preference and to me, these were very comfortable on my head. I have a very large head so I had to adjust these to the max and they fit super well. Ear cups are nice and soft and the padding on the headband is firm on the sides and super squishy on the top. Overall super comfy on my head and I’ve yet to run into any issues with discomfort.Battery Life-Battery life is also pretty great too. 60 hours of battery life is more than plenty and can last you a whole week depending on how often you use them.Overall I think these are great all-around headphones that are great for daily use and travel. Of course, these do have some issues but they don't bother me enough to not recommend these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2023",AEQT6ADH6CI7LIAZKS2DH2DKTMFA,True,36,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R2QVBA1G7PUXO9,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Love 'em,David,5,"Comfortable. Intuitive touch controls. Battery life. Design.Prior to purchase I did lots of research (thank you early adopters that do video reviews and websites that do qualitative reviews). I purchased these over other similarly priced brands based on the available features, price and design style. I have no remorse for the price I have paid.A little more depth:First, sound was a big priority for me -- I wanted a pair of headphones that reproduced sound/music as closely as an original artist may have desired. I found a website, soundguys.com, that provided a frequency-response (an audio-sweep starting from the 10's of Hz to the 10's of kHz is played through the headphones then the output noise difference is measured) graph for the headphones showing a very good sound reproduction (compared to a similarly priced set of Sony headphones these were more true to the input audio sweep).Second was design. I am a big fan of having the cups of the headphones attached to the headband via the swiveling 'pitch fork' design. Mounted/affixed to the middle of the/a headphone-cups. From an engineering/physics perspective, this means the pushing/pressing force exerted by the headband through the cups is centered from the middle of the cups, as opposed to the tops of the cup's--which invariably results in the pushing pressure being more towards the top of the cups (assumptions based on the XM5's design).Third. Comfort. The somewhat flat headband with its padding is forgettable and the pressure it supplies to the cups to the sides of one's (average size) head is sufficient -- maybe a little on the lite side. Also, the inside (head side) of the headband is a rubbery-like material, so no fears of hair/scalp oils dirtying a fabric there.Lastly, a subjective review of the sound, ANC, and call quality. I think the sound is amazing! The ANC is super cool. I've worn these on public transit (daily on the bus, and weekly on the train) and finally feel like I won't have any hearing damage from having to listen to the drone of the engine or cabin noise. You will still have some awareness of sounds around you, especially those of higher pitch/tone, but if you have music going (half volume for me) you will not hear any thing. Pass-through mode is also quite nice, though sometimes other's voices may sound quite (again, due to using half volume).Call quality is great. I held a phone call wherein I had a fan blowing on my head (wind noise). Neither I or my caller could hear any of the noise from the fan.Since owning the headphones, Sennheiser has released a firmware update for the ANC. Before and after the update I cannot empirically say I've notice any difference. Knowing Sennheiser will push updates to further improve the product is also reassuring (though for this price point, I believe most companies are doing this).Several sites/videos say that a similarly priced set of Sony's has better ANC than these, but I'll argue that you don't need a pair of Sony's to enjoy/receive a similar experience!Very subjective final thought: These (in white) look better than the competition.","Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2022",AFESKG7TMN4LQ6DRVCIB355WIX5Q,True,15,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R15B34B8ZDY89M,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and battery life with a couple comprimises,Grant Bohn,5,"If your priority is sound quality and battery life, these are the headphones to get. I listen primarily to electronic music and the bass is just right. It's clear and full, but not overbearing once EQ'd down a couple dB in the app. What you give up for this is comfort and ANC quality. These are not the sort of headphones you forget that you're wearing. They definitely have some heft to them and a higher clamping force than others. They do feel solidly built though. The ANC works well but from other reviews I've read, it falls a bit short compared to Bose and Sony's offerings. It's a give and take, but the momentum's deliver on fantastic sound and industry leading battery life if that's what you're looking for.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2024",AGE7TIJAE6AOGRW2PLXE2CTUAV3Q,True,2,Color: GraphiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RJOEYU7BI5AO4,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars While these sound fantastic, unfortunately the bad overpowers the good",ThereAreOrangesEverywhere,3,"I've been a fan of Sennheiser headphones for years and I have several other wired headphones from them that I've used for years as well. After reading up on the current wireless headphone offerings from various companies I decided to buy these since I already trusted the brand and the reviews were shining.I'm an audiophile hobbyist with a large head that makes most headphones become uncomfortable after a short amount of time being worn. I also have small ears and most in-ear headphones either don't fit at all or slip out within the first 10 minutes. I have some Airpod Pros that I sometimes use, but these also slip out from my ears constantly. The Sennheiser Momentum 4's fit better than a lot of headphones I've had, however after about 30 minutes of use, they become uncomfortable for me. If they just extended out a little further I don't think that would be an issue, but they don't. I wish more headphone companies made their headphones with greater expandable options, but oh well. If you're reading this and also had the large-head problem, I have a pair of AKG K 702as that I've used for a decade and they're very comfortable.The comfort is not the main issue though. It's the software to manage the headphones, and also the software/firmware on the headphones themselves. It has trouble connecting to the headphones consistently. The headphones also would frequently (and randomly) disconnect while listening to music on my iPhone. It was incredibly frustrating, and after reading through some forums I found that it was due to more than one device being in the headphones ""Devices"" list (my wife tried these on her phone at one point). Even though the other device was not actively trying to connect and even had Bluetooth completely off, the issue was happening a lot. Once I removed the 2nd device through the app, the connectivity issues went away.That is not my main complaint with the headphones though. The ANC cannot be turned off. You can adjust it to your hearts content from full blast ANC to full transparency, but ANC is on at all times. That's not necessarily a deal breaker, but for some reason the ANC on these cans gave me instant headaches. I tried researching why this could be happening and how to reduce this, and since these headphones have some adaptive ANC capabilities I tried listening outside, in an empty room, in a car, downtown, etc. - and it always gave me a headache.If the app let you disable ANC entirely I would have gladly kept them. The sound is fantastic, especially for the price. The bass is very rich, the mids are clean and the highs are crisp without being shrill. The soundstage is extremely impressive given these are closed back. I would have thought these cost at least twice what they do on the sound alone. The battery is also super impressive, these lasted almost two weeks of daily use before I had to charge them.Sennheiser is a sound company, not a software company. If they are going to force managing features of their headphone into an app, they really need to build out the app better and have options as simple as turning on/off ANC. While I'm all for new technology and software (I work as a software engineer), I'm more old-school with devices like this specifically for this reason. If these cans had a few actual buttons or switches to toggle ANC and some other basic features instead of relying on an app and swipe gestures, I'd keep them forever.","Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2023",AEVMPVH3K5FBJXFMQMM6YAPNDNUA,True,15,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R24CB2QQ3VORSI,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Not bad but better options for the price,Hayden Compton,3,"I've had these for over 6 months and have been using them near daily since getting them. I don't use full ANC, but the battery lasts for multiple 8-10 hour work days. The headphones are comfortable to wear all day and I don't notice any problems with the clamping pressure or the weight of the headphones sitting on top of my head. The sound quality is great, if you take some time to fine tune the EQ settings. They are also aesthetically pleasing for what it's worth.Most of the problems seem to be software related. Bluetooth switching between phone and laptop is pretty ok but at least once per day my headphones will connect to my phone and I need to shut off the phone bluetooth to get audio from my laptop. Also, there is no ""regular"" mode for the ANC, meaning that you either get the amplified sound outside of the headphones, or can feel the ANC working. There needs to be a setting that turns both off and gives the regular amount of muffling over ear headphones would normally provide. I also despise the fact that I need to use the Sennheiser app on my phone to control EQ or amount of ANC, why not make a simple desktop app that can do the same?","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2024",AFKOEAETUFFKKOLH7WK5CIUZCF4A,True,0,Color: Black/CopperStyle: Special EditionPattern: Headphones
RONNQB3KB0IWS,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding headphones and extraordinary battery but iOS app did not work.,PMJ,4,"I received these headphones and put them on my head and they immediately paired with my iPhone (14 Pro Max). Touch controls are a little tricky but they do work. Sound is warm, balanced and very pleasant. I have a large head and the headphones feel comfortable covering my ears correctly. They seem to be light and well balanced. Sound is well balanced without being bass heavy or 'lumpy' with excellent detail on all the types of music to which I listen (mainly jazz, classical, electronic jazz and fusion with classic pop thrown in). I have yet to compare with the direct wired connect or via USB. Probably the best noise reduction headphones I have heard and are much smoother than the Sony XM4 and XM5 and less processed than the Bose QC 45s.The iOS app did not work. I installed it after the headphones had paired with my iPhone (as instructed by the instructions), started the app which showed that they had connected but when I tapped the headphone icon, it said it had not connected and I had to power off and remove the headphones from the bluetooth list on my phone. I performed the necessary changes and tried again with no success. I tried this 5 or 6 times with the same results. I gave up and tried a number of other strategies. I reset the headphones, deleted and reinstalled the app all to no avail.The headphones sound great but the inconvenience of trying to configure them manually is less helpful so I decided to send them back.Update 1: I also have an Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra) and tried the installation of the app on that phone. BT pairing was more problematic but once paired the app worked correctly. I reset the headphones using the app (deleting the BT pairing list) and updated the headphones firmware. After doing this I tried again on the iPhone and it worked correctly this time. I am not sure whether it was the complete reset to factory settings or the updated firmware but it now appears to work on both iOS and Android.","Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2023",AGTBK447OV5VAYFLVLFCMC3NOCDA,True,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RW0GW7VS1ML79,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Punching WAY above their price point but have several unfortunate annoying features,Jordan Sage,4,"I have recently trued out a number of headphones across a variety of price points (e.g., the HifiMan Arya Stealth, B&W PX7, B&O H95). These beat out all the headphones that cost more than double. They were the most engaging of the wireless 'phones to listen to and the ones I wanted to keep coming back to. The are fun and energetic sounding, and are pretty generous in sound quality across the timbres. There is nothing these do that stands out sound-wise as super great - but no great sins anywhere either, and I did not find another bluetooth headphone that had such a good, balanced whole-picture sound like these do.I did, however, almost return these.The bluetooth interrupted several important business calls with no prompting from me whatsoever (and again, I had a half dozen Bluetooth headphones by my phone and none of them automatically interrupted more than 10-15 minutes into a call - totally unprompted - like these did).The other issue is that Sennhieser tried, I suppose, to get fancy with the touch controls on the side of the Right can. The issue with this is, if you touch or rest them against anything, the buttons will go off haphazardly. No other headphone I tested had any such issue. If you even lift these to scratch your ear, they will shut off or do something unintended. The good thing though is when you are ready to listen, you put them on your head and they will synch near instantaneously and be ready to play music. That's cool. But I am learning to live with all the unwanted features and touch activation of these.Altogether, I don't believe anything will touch these at the price point, and you would be hard-pressed to find many options under $1,000 that don't require an amplifier that will either. The feature set is annoying and intrusive. The design is bland and cheap looking. But they are comfortable to wear and they sound great. I guess that is just enough.","Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2023",AGUUYWB4JEORCZRCDA47JC4J2OQA,True,14,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R1ZBIQTOJ15PHY,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars But are they, are they really?",Lost_And_Confused,3,"I am really hesitant to write a review in light of how many people have left reviews that sound like they would give their first born for these things. I am not in that camp. I have several sets of over-the-ear and in-ear headsets including the Apple Airpod Max and the new Sony MX5. Having used equipment from Senn for 30 years, I am familiar with their products and how their philosophy, so many others, has changed over that time with a leaning towards mass market. Oh, I get it...make money or close the doors. All that said, here is my real world experience. Upon opening them, I like the case, the wired adapter, etc. The headset is lightweight and very comfortable, even when wearing with glasses. That said, they are the ""cheapest looking/feeling"" headset from Senn I have ever seen...they really feel like cheap plastic crap...but that is not why you buy a headset. Just setting expectations here. The battery life claim of 60 hours is absolutely comical - I have been getting more around 12 hours (calls/music/online meetings - almost all with ANC). The ANC itself is not at the level of Apple or Sony. It works, and I have been on a couple flights with them. There does not seem to be any background noise filtering on the microphone side though - certainly not on par with Apple or Sony, though the ANC works well enough for the wearer. Max volume is lower than other brands, if that is important to you, but certainly loud enough. Bass response is significantly BETTER than Apple or Sony, though the sound quality as a whole is muddier with less staging than others. The pairing has been fairly smooth - no where as seamless as say the Airpod Max's if you are in an Apple ecosystem, but on par with most other brands. The app is a bit pointless, but given that the single button and touch controls arent the greatest, it is helpful. For example, the pinching/reverse-pinching to engage ANC sort of works...? I did have my first pair of these die after about 10 hours of use - would no longer pair and the lights just did a non stop light show - but got them replaced through Amazon without issue, as I had them only 2 days. Conclusions? Given that the Apple product is always on sale for $100 off, the price point between all three products (The Sony MX5's, the Airpod Max's and these) are within $100 of each other, I would have a hard time recommending these to friends or family. I really cannot find a single compelling reason to select these over competing products. I mean, they are bad by any means, just bland. They don't stand out from a looks, sound, ANC, build quality, functionality, or any other way...they work, well enough, and in the class they are in they are fairly priced. I honestly feel you could do better with the Apple Airpod Max if you are a big Apple user or the Sony MX5's otherwise - and be happier with either of those versus these. In fact, if plastic, lower quality builds, but with good sound, good bass response and decent ANC is your thing, you could do better with the over the ear model from Status Audio and save a couple hundred bucks. Of course, all of the above is my personal opinion, not paid, no free samples, no fancy audio test equipment...YMMV.","Reviewed in the United States September 13, 2022",AFYGCCFUGZL6PNRESNIUYWDTPMJQ,True,30,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3T563LHCTJ4N1,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Love the headphones except for the garbled noise at times!!!!,azsteve01,4,"Sennheiser headphones have been my main headphones for watching TV since 2016 when i purchased the RS-175 wireless headphones. Roku has created a Private Listening mode and you cannot switch from headphone to tv/soundbar speakers easily since Roku disabled the TOSLink/headphone jack when you are using the Dolby sound hardware. A solution was needed and since you can connect to the soundbar via bluetooth the decision was made to find a bluetooth headphone that met my standards. Because of my loyalty to Sennheiser headphones the Momentum 4 were chosen.As stated Roku has created a Private Listening feature that makes it hard to use wire/fibre connection and bluetooth is the best solution to resolve the issues making it easier to switch between speakers and headphones.Major Issue:The only main issue with the Momentum 4 headphones is when you first connect, the sound is garbled for 5 to 10 seconds. You can either wait for the sound to clear up (annoying) or restart the video which can be a pain. Youtube and Plex are my main video apps i use and with youtube having to restart the videos each time gets old fast. The garbled sound is the same no matter what firmware is used.Minor issues:When you have the Momentum 4 connected to the app (iPhone) every time you are disconnected from the TV/Soundbar you have to use the app to reconnect. This is not convenient if the phone is not near. Unfortunately Roku has decided to disconnect any bluetooth connected after 5 minutes of idle time to save battery power on the headphones. This is not a Momentum 4 issue but reconnecting with the app make this cumbersome. Because of this problem the app is not being used at all and the headphones are set to factory default.The fit is not as good as the RS-175, ear cups need to be bigger.Pros:Excellent Sound, Long Battery Life, Noise Cancelling (even cancels out conversations), Touch Features, Light WeightI would recommend these to others but only if Sennheiser fixes the garbled issue.","Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2023",AHVWXOJUZYGFL7XQW5OY73KHERGQ,True,10,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R30434Q2LI61Q,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars great sound, cancellation and battery but . . .",mike,5,"I decided on these because of the reviews. And price was right for me.Here is my honest opinion. Sound is awesome, and noise cancelling is good. The special features (like headphone turn off and on as you take them off and on. Side ear swipe controls and sennheiser app for more controls) Well . . . if they work . . . it is very nice. You can only run the app through your phone. So that is a drawback. I found the swipe controls don't hardly work unless you are using the app itself. So if I have music say on amazon music unlimited through my laptop none of the feature work well, or at all. If I am running my music through my phone and with the app the features work at first but the the longer I listen the less likely they are bound to work. Meaning the swipe controls for vol, skip song and tap on and off and turning on noise cancellations setting. I lose connection more then I should for no reason.Lets just say I have to go back to my phone app to turn on and off the feature to get them to work correctly way too much. So If you are OK with great sound and noise cancellation with a super long battery life and can put up with the flaws of the special features that you paid for, then buy these. They are very comfortable for me. Sound was too good to send them back though, just disappointed in the special features that sometimes work and sometimes not. (haven't used phone feature at all yet)update 06-16-24: So I now have had these about a year now. My opinion has changed and I thought I would update my review. I am old (62) so I still do a lot of listening through my MP3 players (I have several - not always listening through my phone). My biggest gripe when I got them was the controls and getting the touch features to work properly. Well, it may have been operator error and just getting used to the headphones. I don't seem to be having any trouble with any listening device anymore. When I take my headphones off my head they stop and when I put them back on they start. One thing that I had trouble with early on. I have had a chance to try out the phone features and sound since the purchase and it is pretty darn good. I can not compare to other competitors though, And I don't use that a lot.So sound is great, comfort is great, battery is great and features are now upgraded to great as wellI love em.

Tested on multiple devices, all of which are up to date.To future-proof my review (because I won't remember to edit my review once the firmware problems have been addressed), I rated these 4 stars based on the assumption that there will be a future fix to the firmware problems. If taking the firmware into account, I think I'd rate these 2 stars (as of 8/31/2022).Pros:These headphones have quality sound, probably on par with the price point. Not significantly better than my PXC 550-II's, but they do have a bit more depth and bass.Their noise cancellation is good, but not as good as my Bose QC35’s, which is to be expected.The battery life is incredible. I don't think I'm getting 60 hours (volume kept at around 20-40%), but they're still awesome.Cons:These are nowhere near as comfortable as my Sennheiser PXC 550-II headphones. They put more pressure on my ears/temples, and the headband is way firmer. My head is aching after about 30 minutes of use.There are significant firmware issues (my firmware is up to date, as of 8/31/22):When using the auto power off mode, they turn on (and sync to your phone) any time they’re moved. This will of course silence your phone’s alerts, as they’re playing over the headphones that you didn’t mean to turn on.When using the on-head detection, they keep turning on and off while they're sitting around my neck.Whenever I answer my phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max) and change the output to these headphones it just hangs up the phone. Haven't tried answering using the headphone's touch controls, it's possible that would work.While the transparency mode is a nice feature, it's almost laughable compared to my AirPod Pro's and Sony WF-1000XM4's. It sounds just barely better than wearing non-noise cancelling headphones.These can connect to 2 devices at a time, but when switching between paired (and connected) devices (for example: listening to audio on my tablet, when I get a text alert on my phone, which interrupts tablet audio for a second, before switching back to tablet again), and whenever I answer my phone, as mentioned above, audio quits playing over my headphones. My phone says it's still connected, but it doesn't show up as an output in any apps. I have to reconnect it to my phone to get it working again.Whenever I pair them with a new device, it disconnects from existing connected devices. I have to reconnect afterward.As much as I want to like these headphones, until Sennheiser fixes these software issues, it's just not worth the hassle.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2022",AENHFSUN5AOQRWBL5HVKOFBRSN4A,True,56,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R9UOJPHMC1N5R,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones with a few nitpicks,Stan Jarensky,5,"I'm coming from the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless headphones that I've been using for basically everything over the past few years. I bought these new headphones primarily because of AptX-Adaptive, their glowing battery life, and the fact that my M3W were starting to wear down a bit.Let me reiterate; I use these for EVERYTHING. Everything from my phone, iPad, multiple PCs, planes, etc. etc. If you want to use these on PC, I strongly suggest in either an AptX or preferably an AptX-Adaptive transmitter (see the Creative BT-W4) to avoid unnecessary latency. It's an absolute must if you're gaming though you will lose the ability to make calls.Regardless, these sound fantastic. I had no complaints about the M3W and while these aren't a significant upgrade, they do sound clearer and more crisp. The build quality is tricky. On one hand, they lack the metal frame that the M3W had that made them unique and confidence-inspiring. These are almost entirely plastic and their uniqueness has been subdued that it can easily be mistaken for countless other pairs. That being said, they feel solid and the plastic does not feel ready to snap at any point. The earcups in particular are an upgrade in both fitment and leather quality. They lose the ability to fold like the M3W but instead you get a slim HARDSHELL carrying case. I get why some people are against them no longer folding but as someone who constantly takes them out of my backpack, I LOVE the slimmer case.The capacitive touch functions I'm not sure how I feel about yet. The only physical button doubles as a manual on/off and a pairing button. The rest is controlled by the cover of the right ear cuff. Most of the functions are fine and intuitive, but to switch between ANC, off, and transparent hearing, you need to do a weird pinch like you would to zoom on a touch screen. It's particularly weird because there's multiple levels so you need to do it multiple times. I'm sure I'll get used to it but I would've preferred a physical button or switch like the M3W.ANC is good. It's NOT as good as Sony's but it's not far off. I can't say much about the battery life as I've only had them for a day but all reviews are backing up Sennheiser's claims of 60h which is literally class-leading. The Android app for fine tuning settings and EQ is fine. Nothing to write home about. Multipoint connection (pairing to two devices at once) is back though it's not a feature I intend to use very often.All in all, I'm very happy. They're expensive but the price is competitive with their rivals. The main draw for me towards Sennheiser has been AptX support. It's something that most of the competition is missing and as a large amount of my usage is gaming, it's absolutely necessary. But the sound quality is great. The features are great. I'd highly recommend these if you're in the market.","Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2022",AFWSMMKN2GVUKOJA4BDMDRSG7JZQ,True,15,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R3BCMJ8RYR5L76,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Was I just maybe expecting too much?,Giratina,3,"Based on other reviews I decided to pick these up and the btd600 dongle meant to go with it for pc etc, Honestly im pretty disappointed. First the anc may as well not exist as it blocks nothing even when set to max or adaptive, can still hear everything as if its right next to me. Second the sound quality sounds... not sure how to describe it but maybe muddy or sounding like you're listening through a barrier. The headphones also struggle to handle intense songs like edm without distorting any voices while there is any bass and almost vibrates the voice causing it to sound off (ive tested tons of eq settings). Using them wired doesn't seem to fix the quality issue either. The bass itself is fine though once adjusted depending on the song speed. The touch controls turn back on every time you turn these off even when set to off on every device you have it connected to. Comfort wise they do start to bend and hurt your ears after a while requiring constant adjusting. Overall I'm pretty disappointed for something in the $300+ range as they sound like other $100 headphones. There's a chance maybe mine is broken but the hassle of swapping them isn't worth it.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2024",AG5Y4LSKJTORYYBYUOJ3IBGIC2LQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

The major problem I had with this headphone after a couple of days of use was that the ANC started failing and popping.

R3QDH5SFCC0EE9,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Momentum 4 vs Sony WH-1000XM5,Matthew,5,"I've been a Sennheiser fan for a while now and wanted to give these a shot vs the fan favored Sony WH-1000XM5s. Used the Momentum 4s for around a week and was incredibly impressed with the battery life, ease of use, and the sound quality. If you have some audiophile grade equipment with a separate DAC/Amp combo this does not sound as good. That being said, this is miles above alternatives in it's price range.After adjusting to the sound of the Sennheisers for a few days, I immediately had a negative reaction when trying out the Sonys. To my ears they had a noticably dryer sound profile where the highs and mids sounded muffled and flat in comparison (Note: not accuracy flat, just plain dull sounding). The bass is pretty equivalent, at least in EDM/metal/hip hop genres. I listened for a few hours in the Sonys and just couldn't find any songs I thought sounded measurably better than the Sennheisers. Even listening to the same song on the tablet and phone with both headphones back to back, everything was brighter, clearer, and warmer in the Sennheisers and have a noticably better build quality. My first initial reaction to Sennheiser build quality was negative because they felt much lighter than I was expecting having used more serious headphones. The Sonys felt even lighter and more plastic-y/cheaper in comparison.The noise cancelling was noticably better in the Sonys than the Sennheisers, which may or may not be a deal breaker for some. I would imagine the Sonys would perform better on an airplane, but for home/office use I was perfectly happy with both.TLDR: The Sennheisers are the no brainer choice for me.**Momentum 4 quirks/nit picking:- My head gets hot in any headphones with leather ear cups, I could not find alternative/cooler padding which is worth the sound/seal trade off.- The sensors to know if it's on your head are pretty sensitive. It's good when you lift off an ear to hear someone else in the room, they pause. It's bad when you take them off, they 'sleep' on the desk, anything brushes/touches the headphones. It will automatically switch your audio source from your phone back to the headphones. Depending on how often you listen to audio on your phones speaker or are around where these will be when you are not using them, it's easier to turn them off when not in use to avoid having to change your media output on your phone back to the speaker. Samsung phones have a quick media output switch in the drop down quick menu, but not all phones make it this easy.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023",AGJ3EARFU6PJA75WKR76Z7WUOLNA,True,27,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RJB49JIZ1OE9H,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, but not great due to finicky features.",Ryan M Robinson,4,"The sound, noise cancellation, durability, and battery life were the reasons I bought these headphones, and they've delivered in those areas. Sadly, I'm knocking a star off the overall rating because of their ""quality"" of life features and short range.The headphones are meant to sense when they're on your head or not. Sadly, these think they're on my head when they're not, and not on my head when they are, with annoying frequency.Occasionally the ""buttons"" stop working. I use quotes because the actual button works fine, but the tap controls seem to stop working randomly. They'll do the little noise in my ear that indicates the headphones have registered me tapping, but have no actual effect.Further, I live in a house of about 950 sq. ft., yet if I leave the 8x8 room that is my office there's a good chance the sound will start cutting in and out due to the poor range of these headphones. I had a pair of $60 headphones before these, and the range was twice as good on those. This results in sound skipping in and out if I'm more than 6 feet away from my computer, or about 8 feet with no walls in between. It would be nice to be able to fold laundry in the next room over while listening to these, but I cannot.Overall, great sound quality, durability, noise cancelling (very important as I'm work from home with a toddler and an infant in the house), and battery life (I use them 8-10hrs per day and charge once per week), but poor quality of life. For the price, I expected headphones that work correctly.","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023",AESDI6RME6JBOBVQLOLCSJKOA7GQ,True,20,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R2L5D070KJ5IMJ,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars The firmware is not up to par,Lumiere,3,"Pros- Comfortable to wear- Long battery life- Neutral sound- Transparency mode- Works wiredCons- Software is horrible- Firmware is horrible- Transparency mode amplifies wind noises more than voiceMost of my headphones are open back, so I wanted a pair of closed headphones for the office. Since I usually use Sennheiser headphones, that and the transparency mode swayed me to get this over Bose QC45 and Sony 1000XM4.I'm not sure I made the right choice. Almost none of the features work properly.Mine keeps turning off or disconnecting. Listen to 1-3 songs and it'll cut off in the middle of a song. Several times an hour sometimes. Tried it where I don't really have much interference, and same exact thing. Tried wearing it one night to listen to music while sleeping, and it just turned off randomly after about 20 minutes of playing. So it paused my music.Take them off and sometimes they'll still keep playing music. Sometimes, I bump into it laying flat on my desk and it'll start playing music. Tap the right side it clear a click, and music will keep playing. Swipe 2-3 times to change songs and it might do it on the first try or never. Neither my car nor my bluetooth speakers have this type of issues. Then sometimes, you adjust them because they feel like they're falling a bit, and you'll trigger the pause.The battery life is pretty good, thankfully. Because it'll stay on sometimes for hours and not turn off. This is with the 15 minutes auto shut down. So you might come back the next morning and it dropped from 90% to 70% because it never turned off.The transparency mode is... just ok. It makes the AC in my office much louder than when I have my headphones off. Like twice as loud. Unless I turn on max wind ANC. But then sound always sound muffled. But even at max transparency and low music volume, I cannot comprehend anyone talking. It sounds like it amplifies constant noise much more than occasional noise.If I wear them while washing dishes, the ANC works really well here too. So it seems to work best with constant noise.The Android App is also extremely slow. You open it, and it has to connect. After it connects, it's unresponsive for another 5 seconds or so. So it takes 10-15 seconds to open settings.I was expecting a quick button to toggle between listening to music, and transparency mode. Right now, it takes a good 15-20 seconds to adjust. Imagine telling someone to wait 20 seconds while you enable the feature, instead of spending 0.5 second removing them.Additional notes: I didn't buy them for the ANC. I care more about low leakage so I'm not disturbing other people in the office. It's also why I wanted transparency mode, so I can still hear other people if they want something.","Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2022",AGJDE3TR26ZJIIR5CINP4GMUWLCA,True,11,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R2EMRYUEWAB9JV,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Too Much Low Bass; Not Ideal for Aircraft Travel,JCW2,4,"Really good sound, clean and clear with great frequency response. The one sad detail is WAY too much low bass. This is not to say it's bad bass, and it reaches much lower frequencies than most phones. It's tight and musical, but it's enough at the bottom end to cause audible distortion in higher frequencies during dense orchestral passages. (This is one reason speaker manufacturers use separate drivers for bass and treble.) I agree with the excellent review by M&N (under ""Other Countries"") except that only a 1 dB reduction in bass is not enough. These phones start to sound reasonably realistic on music with a lot of low bass after a 6 dB bass reduction (the max provided by the equalizer in the app), but I would prefer even more, preferably affecting only the very low end.Another problem potential buyers should consider is that there seems to be ZERO support from the manufacturer for this product. (Part of the problem could be that Sennheiser's consumer products division has been sold to a new company calling itself ""Sennheiser Hearing,"" so they might get this worked out in time.) So it's currently impossible to get operation and usage questions answered. Right now it appears that the equalizer settings are not applied when listening to a wired audio source. Since this is a major application of noise-cancelling phones -- think airplane travel, where Bluetooth is not allowed -- it constitutes a major drawback.Another issue for travel is the heavy, bulky case that comes with these phones. The phones themselves are reasonably compact, weighing about 10.3 oz, but the case is thicker and way stiffer than necessary to protect them and weighs a hefty 13.7 oz, more than doubling the total.Update 03/09/23: Access to technical support is improving lately, at least by telephone. When I finally got hold of them, I was told that, indeed, it is normal function that the phones do NOT apply any user equalization settings when used with an analog (phone-cable) input.","Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2023",AEPJX4BN6PLNQ7ZQPJYNDJBSBXCA,True,10,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R10V36NAFXZEZA,B0B6GHW1SX,4.0 out of 5 stars Wanted to Rate This Five Stars,Polarbear,4,"I loved these headphones (Momentum 4). It quickly became my favorite, even better than the Sony MX5. The sound was awesome with a full spectrum down to the deepest base without muddy low frequencies as with nearly all other headphones including the MX5. I used these every day for just over a month to put me just out of Amazon return window. Suddenly the right speaker started crackling and popping. I was in such disbelief that this was happening. It was so sad for me that I couldn't listen to them anymore. I was very disappointed, and I really wanted them to work! So I ordered the another pair from Best Buy, and I ordered another from Amazon. Yeah, I really wanted these to work! The same day the Best Buy pair arrived and I started listening to them, it took about 4 hours before this one like the other one started crackling and popping, except it was not as bad, and it was in the left speaker. I was so much more disappointed! Fortunately I was able to return this one to Best Buy right away. I also cancelled the second order from Amazon. I really want to know what's up! I tried everything to make the crackling and popping go away. I restarted my phone, updated the headphone firmware, nothing worked. Now I have a broken pair and I guess I should use the 2-year warranty to have Sennheiser fix it or replace it. Can't return them to Amazon. If I could trust that the next one I receive will last, I would go ahead and get another one right now. Just so you know, I collect Bluetooth headphones, and I have over 30 pairs including the best of Sony, Bose, and other premium brands. I've never had an issue with any of these other pairs. This sucks! My rating of one star is solely due to this issue with two separate pairs. If the pair worked, I would rate them a solid five stars! They are AWESOME! There hope this issue can be fixed. I want my Sennheiser Momentum 4 back! One star should elevate this concern so that others are cautious when they buy one, and know that it may fail within so many hours of use.

My usage is primarily on flights and at the gym. I wanted to improve on the sound quality that I was getting from my AirPods Pro 2. For me it was between these, the Bose and Sony. If you listen to all three headphones in noise canceling mode with nothing playing, there is an advantage to the Bose and Sony. They absolutely have better noise canceling, but when listening to music or a movie it is much less noticeable. I let my decision be based on which one sounded better and the Sennheiser was the clear winner.

R2LOLFHZ6R8BHD,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Sound great and usage is very streamlined,Henry,5,"I like how most Sennheiser headphones sound, and these are no exception. The app also lets you further tune the sound to your liking if you feel the need to, and if you don't want to play around with the EQ options, you can just use the ""sound personalization"" feature which is basically a quiz that will help create an optimal sound setting for you. The usage experience with these is the most streamlined I have had with any headphones so far. I use my headphones primarily with my PC, and with older headphones switching the connection from my PC to my phone was a pain, and because of that I rarely did it. With these, you have multi-point connection, which allows you to connect to 2 devices at once, and the headphones will switch between them based on which one is playing audio. That, combined with the auto on and off feature, means I can just pick these up off my desk and put them on, then use my PC and/or phone as needed without thinking about it, and then just plop them back on my desk when I'm done and they will shut down automatically. There are however a couple of things I can think of to complain about. Number one is I wish Sennheiser made a dedicated Windows app to change settings directly from a PC, but the multi-point connection means this isn't really a big deal anymore because they are always connected to my phone anyway if I want to change settings. Number 2, I would like to have some kind of audio queue when I reach the midpoint between transparency mode and ANC. As is, when you are using the touch controls to scroll between full ANC and full transparency mode, you get an audio queue when you reach either of those settings, but the midpoint where you have neither ANC nor transparency mode active isn't obvious unless you pull out the app and check where it is set. A small issue but it would further improve ease of use with these. Overall, I'm super happy with them.

After these arrived, I did a direct comparison on these vs Sony’s XM5’s, with EQ to my liking and without (across several genres.) The M4’s even without any EQ adjustments beat my XM5’s with them. Man, these things sound great. Clear, precise, open sound. The treble is truly so much more detailed than on the XM5’s, and the midrange and bass feel balanced in more naturally. When I switched back to XM5’s to compare, I was actually shocked at just how much I felt like I was missing in comparison.Comfort:The XM5’s spoil you a bit with their insane plush earcups and super light weight, but I was expecting a bigger difference between those and the M4’s. For me, these are perfectly comfortable. XM5’s definitely win here, but the SQ on the M4’s more than makes up for that.Noise Cancelling:I’m not the person to give the best feedback on this, it’s the last thing I care about. However, If noise cancelling happens to be your main consideration, it’s XM5 here.Setup/connectivity:I was prepared for problems and inconveniences based on reviews and got none.

R36ZIV2E3IZWRL,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite noise cancelling headphone,WT,5,"I recently added the Momentum 4 to my collection of noise cancelling headphones. The others I currently own are the Sennheiser PXC550, Technics EAH-F70N, Sony WH-1000XM4 and WH-1000XM5. I don't have any Bose headphones because I don't care for their sound signature. For noise cancellation, the Sony XM5 are the best, but only by a small margin over the XM4. However, the XM5's adaptive noise cancellation cannot be turned off and for some, this is a big negative. There are people who want maximum noise cancellation all the time. Not just when they are in very noisy conditions. The Momentum 4 also uses adaptive noise cancellation but unlike the XM5, it can be turned off.For maximum noise cancellation, I prefer the XM5. Especially for long flights. I also carry the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds for when I get tired of wearing headphones. In almost all other situations, I prefer the Momentum 4 and Momentum True Wireless 3 earbuds for their ""nearly as good"" noise cancellation and superior comfort and sound. I prefer the Sennheiser sound because I find the Sony to be too bright for long listening sessions. They can be fatiguing for me. The Sennheiser sounds more natural, and the sub-bass is really good for a headphone. I also find the Momentum 4 to be more comfortable than the XM5 especially if I wear them for more than an hour or so.Random thoughts:The XM5 is louder than the Momentum 4.The XM5 and Momentum 4 cases are not as compact as the XM4 and PXC550 respectively.The XM5 and Momentum 4 cases are the same shape, but the Momentum 4 case is slightly smaller.The Momentum 4 has thicker earpads and are more comfortable than the XM5.The Momentum 4 sub-bass will rattle your brain more than the XM5.The Momentum 4 has an automatic switch-on/off feature that can be somewhat annoying at times.

I've been using Bose earbuds and Airpods for so long that I'm just used to the music being pumped directly into my ear drum, which in my opinion, helps to create the clearest sound at the lowest volume possible. With these being neither fully noise canceling nor earbuds that push music directly to the eardrum, I feel like I really need to crank up the sound in order to hear my music the way I'm used to hearing it. And my Airpods Pro undeniably produce a better sound when I'm out and about taking walks along noisy city streets.What do I like about them? Honestly, I don't really know. The overall sound quality is good...they're just hard to hear sometimes. The battery life is excellent...far superior to any headphones or earbuds I've ever had.I will definitely continue exploring other options in the market. Really don't want to crank out a couple grand on a pair of headphones, but I'm low-key thinking that might be what it comes down to if I'm going to get what I'm truly looking for.","Reviewed in the United States October 4, 2023",AEPG7XCHXICPJZTPIASYUG7RZZVQ,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R1HEPV34OXKJS3,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Vastly superior to Sony in a couple of ways...,Amazon Customer,5,"While I used them regularly, I took very good care of my Sony wh-xb910n headphones, and yet they still fell apart within a year. I know it's slightly unfair to compare the Momentum 4 to this particularly Sony headphone but I didn't expect the Sony's to compare in terms of sound quality (they don't come close) or noise cancelling (the Sony's were pretty similar honestly... very good on both). But I did expect quality design and construction since it's virtually identical to higher priced Sony's. Bottom line: Sennheiser has quality construction and Sony doesn't. As soon as you pick up a pair of the Sony's, it's easy to tell that they are somewhat fragile. I even had a pretty good notion of where they would break... and I was right. The Sennheiser's are much more robust, and really feel like they can handle some tough use.I also found the app to be very intuitive and easy to use, unlike a few other reviewers... definitely easier than the Sony app.My only slight complaint is the touch sensitive control feature. It isn't ""bad"" but it does take a bit of practice.","Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2024",AGFKBQL6TWXLISK67N7TPEDORGPQ,True,0,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

I do know why.If you are looking for the best anc from a pair of cans, the Momentum 4 is not for you and you would probably be happier with the Sony mx5’s.But, I’d you are looking for the best and distinctive sounding headphones you’ve ever heard, then, these are the one’s you are looking for, then it’s the momentum 4’s, accept no substitutes. Oh, and they are extremely comfortable, have and amazing sixty hours of battery life, sound good on calls, and have pretty darn good anc.I must admit, the app and the feature set though it looks good on paper, it is kinda wonky. But that’s not the reason I bought these headphones.What is important is that they are extremely comfortable (which I rate first, as it doesn’t matter how excellent your headphones are, if you can’t wear them on your head). The sound quality, and battery life(60 hours with anc on!). With the Momentum 4’s, you can listen to amazing, non fatiguing sound, in complete comfort for long periods of time.What makes the sound so awesome? They pretty much hit every nail on the head. The bass is both veeeerrryyy deep, but punchy as well. It isn’t mushy and dispersed. With headphones, you almost always have to make a compromise between punchy bass and mushy bass. With the the Momentum 4’s you, in no way need to make that compromise. They have by far, the best sound stage I’ve heard on a set of headphones. Each element, instruments, sound effects and vocals have their own space and aren’t. The imaging is sublime. Again, the bass is deep(very)and punchy, the highs are crystal clear, and the mids are excellent in both low mids and high. The phone quality is excellent by the way.The Momentum 4’s are not only the best anc headphones I have ever heard, they are the best headphones I’ve ever heard, anc or not.If you want great sound that you can listen to comfortably, forever, buy these now.","Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2023",AHJOS5WYW3YIWLVWSLOGIYICWD3A,True,5,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

Not to confuse you, they are comfortable and “steady” on the head, when you walk, or just laying on the couch. But when im working out it just feels like they are about to fall down my head. I am not sure if this is special problem of this headphones, or just general issue among all over-ear headphones.Except what written above, these headphones are perfect. Especially because of rich/balanced sound, and features in the app. Compared to meze 99 they sound more rich, and better overall, even though meze are wired.

R39Z3XS2ONJTUB,B0B6GHW1SX,3.0 out of 5 stars Volume is an issue,Evan,3,"For the price, I honestly expected more.These fit well, feel nice, and have a good weight to them which make them feel solid but not heavy. But for $350+ headphones, I expected more from the audio quality.Am I accustomed to a standalone amp and wired closed-back headphones? Yes. Do I use wireless headphones otherwise? All the time (mostly buds). Do these senheisers blow me away? No.The details in the audio is very solid, but where it lacks is sheer power. Do I intend to blast my ears at full volume? Absolutely not, but with ALL my other wireless headphones, I'm usually floating around half volume, while with these, I'm always a click or two away from full volume, which is crazy... I'm only 35 and have near perfect hearing, so something with these just feels off, like something an update could rectify to unlock a bit more volume capacity. I've heard others trying 3rd party apps to increase volume, which does work, but I find that an annoying workaround.The noise canceling is almost non existent, which I read prior to buying but I was still surprised at their lack of noise canceling ability. Ambient noise is audible, and this is why the volume is an issue, it's a vicious cycle.The touch controls work well but can be a little finicky, especially the autopause feature which stops music upon removing the headphones from your head.Overall, good headphones, but not amazing for the price and those who like to hear their music in louder environments.","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2023",AEPQE6ZBDHU2PHPUNTN5CDBSPFNA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

R3C9NCI2LLQD48,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser vs Sony vs Apple,Calder Akin,5,"After watching countless hours of review videos and sampling multiple headphones firsthand I narrowed my final selections down to the Momentum 4’s ($280 currently on Amazon), and a pair of certified refurbished (eBay) AirPod Max’s ($390) and Sony Xm5’s ($280). My budget was under $400. I also considered the Bowers & wilkins px7 s2 but didn’t have a chance to try them out firsthand so I excluded them from my selection process.Ultimately I decided to go with the Sennheisers. To me the Sonys are the most comfortable (so light, it’s as if there’s nothing on your head!) but the ear-cup itself is the shallowest of the three- my ears stick out a little so this was a consideration. Also, I have an iPhone and many reviews said the audio was better on the XM5’s when connected to androids due to the Ldac etc. The Apples sound the best when it comes to immersive experience (spacial audio wow!) but the limited EQ flexibility, and the extra money I’d have to spend on a real case plus wires to plug into a jack when flying outweighed (no pun intended- but these things ARE heavy!) the luxury feel.The Momentum 4’s (M4) are very comfortable with plush faux leather on the ear cups. I wish they were a bit bigger of an oval shape (something to consider if you have big ears) but for me they fit just right. The ear cup has more substantial padding and recesses slightly deeper than the Sonys over the ear. All three of these headphones have the same sliding headband design which I really like.Where the M4’s really shine however is in the audio department. It just sounds so clean in my opinion. I own a pair of Beats Studio 3’s which are my go-to gym headphones. You don’t get a “pounding” heavy sound with the M4’s like you do with the Beats but that’s fine with me. They also don’t get as loud as my Beats but I didn’t buy them for either of these reasons. I wanted a pair of headphones for traveling, taking the dog for a walk, and listening to music/tv around the house. Speaking of watching TV with them, there’s an EQ preset through the app which is designed for podcasts. I set the headphones to this feature the other night while watching a basketball game and it sounded amazing! Also there’s this cool feature for phone calls which you can adjust through the app where it sounds like you aren’t wearing headphones and you can hear your own voice clearly - muffled sounding phone calls are a thing of the past!Overall I’m incredibly happy with my purchase. They aren’t quite as comfortable as the Sony’s- it’s not that they’re uncomfortable it’s just they have more weight to them and more of a clamp on the head. And they don’t have the seamless syncing ability and build quality of the Apples. Also, their noise cancelling and transparency mode is slightly below both. But for the price and sound quality these were the best fit for me.Pros:* price ($279 on Amazon currently which is around $70 below retail)* Clean, pure audio that sounds good regardless of your favorite genre of music.* Comfort- plush pads with ample space for my ears to be enclosed. Easily adjustable sliding headband.* Rigid case (slightly smaller than the XM5’s)* Battery life (60 hours!)* Auto-off feature when taken off and not used for 15 minutes or more depending on how you set it (great if you often forget to turn off your headphones!)* Easy to navigate app. I know some have complained about the app but I’ve had zero issues with it- maybe the firmware has been fixed with the most recent update?* No noticeable hissing sound with ANC.* 2 year manufacturers warranty* Usb-c and traditional 3.5mm connectivity. Also they come included with a two-prong airplane jack.Cons:* I appreciate the creativity making most of the functions of the headphones accessible via touchpad on the right ear-cup, but the pinching/expanding feature to adjust ANC/transparency is useless. Thankfully you can just double tap the headset to switch between these settings.* They don’t get super loud, well at least compared to my Beats, so I wouldn’t consider these a great gym option. (Edit: there’s a thread on Reddit that gives some pointers on how to increase the overall volume- especially if you have an iphone. Worth checking out, the adjustments I made did seem to work)* They aren’t water/sweat resistant, which is another reason not to wear them to the gym.* ANC is effective but not on the level of the Sonys or Apples.* The auto pause feature is pretty sensitive. Something to keep in mind if you adjust your headphones often during usage. If you lift them off your head, even to just change position the audio can unintentionally pause. (Edit: there’s a way to turn off this function in the app)TLDR; Best Bluetooth noise cancelling over ear headphones currently available.","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2023",AGGIZAHMHFHO4J6OU7FMAHUD4MMA,True,162,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R1AC58E4VI0C2P,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Music to my ears!,DDAY,5,"I just received these Sennheiser Momentum 4 cans about 7 days ago. I bought them for $270, and now I see you can get them $20 less. I made the purchase, despite the negative reviews posted on Amazon simply because I have learned that reviews don't tell the whole story. Such as often times when it comes to Bluetooth devices, there will be a new firware/update that will need to be done, depending on how old the product is. In my case, that was the case. The firmware update was easy, took maybe a minute or two, and I was off and running. I have owned, and sold several headsets, from JBL, Beats, SkullCandy, Sony and yes, Bose. Now, for me, and how I like my music to sound, the Sennheiser 4s are by far the best sounding Bluetooth headphone to grace my melon. Mids, highs and lows work amazingly well. Wind and string instruments sound crisp, and suppurb! The lows/bass work harmoniously with the above mentioned. The Sennheiser equalizer is easy to use, and gets the job done. Touch controls: they take getting used to, but, once you adapt, it works great. Yes, at times you may pause music when touching the right ear cup, but again, you will adapt and recover. Comfort. These cans are extremely comfortable. Even for my large head. Ear cushions are comfy, as is the head cushion. Could it use more cushion? Maybe if you wear them for 8 hrs straight. Weight. Yes, they way a tad bit more than the competition, but, that is to be expected as the battery is slightly larger...hence why you can get up to 60hrs of life on these bad boys! The cans don't feel cheap, they feel solid. And that is something I can appreciate. Are these cans perfect? They are as close to perfect that you will get (IMHO) on Bluetooth headsets. Are there better cans out there? Sure, If you go wired, and spend a few hundred more, then yes. Even Sennheiser wired headsets (depending what model you get) are better, but that's because they are wired. Of course they will sound better.One thing I didn't discuss is noise canceling. They get the job done in fine fashion. I have tried the Sony 5s, and they are slightly better than the Senn 4s. I have made several phones calls, FaceTime calls and the voice activation works wonderfully! I am 7000+ miles away from home, and not one complaint on how I sound, or, how the other end sounds. Lastly, battery life. It claims you can get 60hrs of life once fully charged. That is a fact, as I have tested that claim and 59+ hours the first charge, not quite there for the second charge. Mind you, it will lose an hour or two depending on what you have activated.Accessories. Well, you can listen to these cans wired, especially if you run out of charge. You will need a dongle (I purchased one from Amazon) and they sound great. It will sound different, and you may need to adjust you equalizer. The case the cans come with is a solid, good quality case with charging type C cable, 3.5 wired jack, and an airplane adaptor to plug your cable into so you can listen to movies or music that the plane is playing. And it all is neatly stored within the case.Final thoughts:I honestly feel that alot of the issues that some people reviewed on Amazon is these headsets have ""buggy"" issues, or connectivity issues. Perhaps some just don't know how to do firmware updates, the phone they are using is dated? Not sure, all I know is mine cans fired right up, and I did the update straight away. These cans have Bluetooth 5.2, so it should be able to connect to any device that's out there currently. Yes, touch panel does take some getting used to. Much like driving a truck, then driving a sport car. It may take a moment to get familiar with the vehicle, but once you do, it's a piece of cake.I decided to take a chance, I did my research outside of Amazon reviews, and watched the pros on YouTube, and that's how I ended up buying these. Big risk considering I am a world away. Give em a try, you can always return them if they aren't for you.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AFGWGUIMRTG4L3M52MRY7QDFRDIQ,True,41,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R2CIT7PKP36F3M,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Exceptional sound quality, great battery life. Noise cancellation is OK. Updates could make it 5/5.",Amazon Customer,4,"Sound quality on these is GREAT - No complaints whatsoever. Music sounds good, TV dialogue is easily understandable, full range of sound is audible. Mic quality is good, but not as top of the line as the sound.Battery life is pretty in line with what's advertised. Expect to charge at least twice weekly if you use your headphones heavily.I'm not crazy about the touch controls. They seem finicky to me, and don't give you good feedback. Instead of being able to adjust transparency on a percentage scale, I'd much rather have a quick switch for going between fully transparent and fully noise cancelling.I had some problems initially with pairing and set up. When connected to my Windows 10 PC, they appear as two different sound devices - Headphones & headset. Quality when connected as a headset is terrible, so make sure it's connected as headphones. Headset connection can be disabled in output devices if it's connecting the wrong one as default, but make sure it's left enabled in the input devices list or you won't be able to use the microphone.The app is...Not great. No desktop version as far as I can tell, so you have to control it from a phone or emulator. I ended up turning off almost all of the app features. Auto adjusting noise cancellation didn't seem to work properly, and I have no idea what ""Comfort calling"" is because most of the app features don't have descriptions (This one isn't listed in the manual either). On head detection has annoyed me with every device I've ever had it on, but I'll concede that before I turned it off this was the least terrible implementation that I've experienced.Initial pairing experience was troublesome, but now that all my devices (Desktop, laptop, phone) are paired I'm able to transition between them all pretty smoothly. Occasionally I'll have to turn bluetooth off on one device or another because I'll get continuous ""Connected/Disconnected"" messages while listening on a different device.Bottom line, if audio quality is your most important factor in looking for headphones, you'll probably be happy with these - I definitely am. That being said, they aren't the most user friendly headphones currently. I'm hoping that software/firmware updates might improve the experience, and I'll update this review if that happens.","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2022",AGUYYNC6G5RGNFL4HD6LXEB6JJCA,True,32,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R1IVGTBWY7A3K4,B0B6GHW1SX,"5.0 out of 5 stars First Sennheiser purchase, highly impressed!",Shara Simpson,5,"I obsessively researched before buying these Sennheiser Momentum 4s. I had it narrowed down to Bose QC Ultras, Sony WH-1000XM5s, or these. Ultimately it came down to sound quality for me. The quality and clarity of any music genre I tested it with was far and away superior to Sony or Bose. These don't have the absolute best ANC compared to those, but it's still top tier. If you are looking for a fully immersive, lost in the music type of experience with your headphones, Sennheiser is the way to go. And the battery life is absolutely insane! I've had these for 3 weeks with almost daily use (at least an hour a day but usually more) and I haven't had to charge them at all since the first initial charge - they are still sitting at 40%! Sennheiser says they should last 60 hours with ANC at half volume and that seems accurate. No other headphones come close to that kind of battery life. I really love the Sennheiser app as well, it's packed full of useful features. The EQ on these is fully adjustable using the app. I used the ""My Sound Check"" feature and created sound profiles for various genres of music and places of use, but you can also manually adjust the 5-band EQ. You can save each sound profile and even use the Sound Zone feature to have the headphones automatically switch to a different sound profile based on your location (ex. gym settings versus work settings). There is also a Bass Boost toggle if you want head pounding bass. I really like the two-tone look of these - I got them in white, but the headband is covered in a very nice textured tan fabric and the earcups are tan as well. They are extremely comfortable for hours of use at a time. The case is super sturdy and nice. I put a size comparison pic in this review with the case next to my Kindle - the case is large since the headphones don't fold. This makes them less than ideal for use when traveling because they do take up a lot of space in your bag. The first week of use, I did have connection issues. They would randomly disconnect from whatever music streaming service I was using at the time and I would have to reconnect. Thankfully that went away and I haven't had any further connectivity problems. I don't use these for phone calls so can't review the mic or call quality yet. Overall I think I made the right choice with these, and am extremely happy with my purchase.

R27AA754NCZRA9,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good on paper, bad on my head",Sam,3,"I was going back and forth between Sony WH-1000XM5 (XM5) and these headphones (SM4), and I decided to give these a shot since at the time of this purchase, I was able to get these for $279.83 before taxes while the XM5 are listed at ~$400 before taxes.On paper, the SM4 sounded great, double the battery life, supposedly better sound quality, and a not-so-shabby noise cancelling.However, after trying them for a week, I decided to return them. I will list the pros and cons below.PROS 1. Long battery life – I only charged it once during the whole week and it was still going strong. 2. Very solid construction – premium materials that feel good to the touch. 3. Pretty nice carrying case – feels solid and durable, and you don't need to fold the headphones when you put it in so it's simpler to stow in case. BUT I have to reset the positions of the earcups to fit into case, which means I have to always re-adjust to my head size before putting it on. 4. Great sound – I'm not an audiophile, but it sounded good. A friend said he picked up on more chords behind a Taylor Swift song that he hasn't heard before (he listens to Taylor Swift 24/7). 5. Sleek design – unlike the SM3, the SM4 has design that I like: minimalistic and modern.CONS 1. Subpar app-headphone interface – the app is glitchy, and I find myself wait around 10 seconds for the app to say ""connected"" to the headphones (even though the headphones are connected to my iPhone via Bluetooth); after which point, I can go in and change some settings. Also, I did have some stutters in the app that gave me an overall feel of unpolished. 2. Too heavy and too much clamping force – on paper, the weight and clamping force differs by 0.1-ish, but from trying out my friends' XM5s and my SM4, I feel a pretty noticeable difference in how hefty the headphones feel on my head. Simply put, SM4 feels tight on my head and XM5 feels like I can forget that I’m wearing them after a while—this is personal preference, but personally, SM4 felt less comfortable and a tad too heavy for long study sessions. 3. Headache-inducing noise cancelling – the noise cancel isn't as good as the XM5 indeed, but I think there is a bigger problem: the noise cancelling feels peculiarly headache-y. I have airpod pros, plus I have tried the XM5s, and I have to say, the SM4's noise cancelling is by far my least favorite. If I were to describe it, I would say it feels like the feeling I get from being on an airplane for 5+ hours with headphones on. All in all, I opted to have no noise cancelling on due to this uncomfortable feeling it gives me. 4. Touch control – the touch control is pretty responsive, but even if I touch the very edge of the earcups, it registers as a gesture, which gets annoying when I'm trying to adjust my headphones or taking them off for a second. After a few days, I almost wanted to turn them off. ALSO, XM5's cupping gesture to activate transparency mode is extremely desirable, especially since I'm a college student who finds myself studying with my friends a lot. AND the SM4 does not have a gesture to turn off noise cancelling; I have to either pinch in/out multiple times or go into the app and adjust the slider, and it gets very annoying quick.If you have read this far, I applaud your diligence to find the best headphones for you. Personally, I have ordered the XM5 and I will try it on and probably keep it. BUT, an advise for you if you are like me. I dug through the internet and have looked at countless written, video, and professional reviews of so many headphones, but I have to say, it all comes down to personal preference. You MUST go to a Best Buy, where they have headphones on racks that you can try on for yourself. Also, don’t be afraid to order them on amazon and try it out for a week and return them and move onto the next one. Amazon’s return policy is pretty good and if you use the headphones with care and keep the packaging that the headphones came in, you can most likely return them for free. I hope you find the right pair of headphones for yourself, reader.","Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2023",AE4ZGTN75KVUPUK7VO5OXU4BKWJA,True,131,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

I've been immersed in all things high-end audio for more than 40 years, and listened to a lot of stuff, including headphones.

Bluetooth simply didn't cut it for prolonged enjoyment because of the lower, compressed resolution and frequency.But, that all changed in late 2022. On a whim, I tried the newish Sony WH-1000XM5 and was surprised at how good they sounded. The noise cancellation was excellent with little of the rushing elevator sound--and boy, the sound was terrific. For the first time I felt like using a wireless headphone wasn't a big step-down from wired. The M5's soundstage was truly impressive, rivaling my Focal Clear MG wired 'phones. Plus, the M5s were much lighter, more portable, and a bit more fun. The new Sony's were a magnitude better than the older Sonys, as well as anything wireless I'd heard before.That got me wondering: If the Sony's are this good, maybe something by Bowers and Wilkins or Sennheiser would be even better. After all, Sony caters to the mass market, which is generally not that discerning when it comes to audio. Whereas, B&W and Sennheiser typically aim more for the smaller, high-end, audiophile market. So, I started comparing the MX5 to the new B&W Px7 S2 and new Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless.Here's what I found:In the past, like the Sonys, the B&Ws and Sennheiser wireless 'phones were disappointments, falling far short (for me) of their wired, non-NC counterparts. No longer, because the new models are dramatically better. Without going into lots of detail (something audiophiles love to do), both the Px7 S2 and the Momentum 4 are a leap forward in every way than their predecessors. Are they better than the MX5, yes, but not by much. As others have said, the MX5 has better software, better NC, is very portable, and pretty comfortable. For many, the slight compromise in audio quality may not be a big deal. I could easily live with the MX5. However, my priority is sound quality since I seldom use NC, and, even if the software of the B&Ws and Sennheisers is only acceptable.Therefore, it came down to the Px7 S2 vs. Momentum 4 for me. The Px7 S2 is much nicer to look at, exuding high quality. The Momentum 4, not so much. In fact, they look like an MX5 knock-off with a few upscale touches. The software of both the Px7 S2 and Momentum 4 is mediocre at best, albeit functional.Now about the sound. The Px7 S2 sound really, really good. Bass, Midrange, Treble are all top notch, if not perfect. They're fun to listen to, with a wide soundstage and energetic dynamics. That said, they're tuned to emphasize the lower frequencies a bit too much for my tastes. At first, this makes music and voices more vibrant and robust, but, over time, it gets tiring, and you're realize what you're hearing isn't all that accurate. If I hadn't listened to the Momentum 4s, I probably would have been quite happy with the Px7 S2.But, I did listen to the Momentum 4. It edges out thePx7 S2 and MX5 with its overall excellent balance and accuracy. Nothing is exaggerated: voices, instruments, timbre, tone are all just right to my ears. Maybe not as exciting as the Px7 S2 upon first listen, but the Momentum 4s seduce you the more you use them. There's no need for lots of equalization, or fiddling to get the sound right; its all been done at the factory. Besides the accurate representation of voices and instruments, the Momentum 4s are monsters when it comes to soundstage. The placement of everything is wide, yet accurate. You can feel the space and air between different instruments, and where the singer is in the studio or stage. Layering and detail are pretty amazing considering these are bluetooth, closed-back 'phones. Sennheiser (Actually: Sonova, because Sennheiser sold their headphone division to this maker of hearing aids in 2021.) did their homework when it came to the Momentum 4. Plus, that 60 hours of battery life is icing on the cake.Let me say this in conclusion. You won't go wrong with any of these three headphones. They're all great. I preferred the Momentum 4 because it represents the overall most satisfying package for the money, but you might prefer the Px7 S2, or the MX5, more. One last word, regarding the buggy software of the Momentum 4: I found none. With the latest updates, Sennheiser/Sonova seems have fixed the issues of poor connectivity and consistency. All system functions worked perfectly the entire time I've been using the Momentum 4s. Enjoy!","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2023",AEZIPLEDJYRIGVJKWFWRH44LK4TQ,True,429,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
RQ0W5FUGCFR5X,B0B6GHW1SX,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, bad UX Design.",Cacho K,2,"The PXC-550 headphones were my go-to for the past three years, striking the perfect balance between quality sound and comfort, with just a couple of drawbacks: a lack of USB-C support and less-than-ideal battery life. Eager for an upgrade, I transitioned to their successor MOMENTUM, hoping for improvements. On paper, the new model seemed to promise just that—a better, more refined listening experience. However, while the upgrade delivered in some areas, it faltered in others, revealing design flaws that the PXC-550 had already mastered.On the plus side, the sound quality is exceptional, with noise cancellation that effectively silences the outside world, and a battery life that feels almost endless. These improvements alone make the headphones a significant leap forward.But not all changes are for the better. The new design is bulkier. More frustratingly, the intuitive fold-to-turn-off (and on) feature of the PXC-550 has been omitted. The satisfying click of the folding switch, which once brought a sudden moment of reassurance—a Deus ex Machina moment between you and this piece of machinery—is gone. Now, turning off the headphones requires holding down a button for an awkwardly long pause, a process that can accidentally trigger pairing mode instead of powering down. This seemingly small change significantly impacts the user experience, transforming seamless transitions into moments of annoyance.Imagine this: You're about to start your car journey, only to discover your headphones have remained on, constantly attempting to connect to your phone, disrupting the peace of your drive. Or picture yourself at your desk, a sudden visitor arrives, and you're caught in an awkward dance of trying to turn off your headphones, a delay that interrupts the flow of life.This shift from the elegantly simple act of folding your headphones to turn them off and on to a cumbersome, button-dependent process adds up, not just in seconds wasted but in the sheer inconvenience it represents, especially when you know how effortless it once was. The PXC-550 made life smoother, akin to having a trusted steed by your side in the relentless battle of daily existence—a companion so reliable, its absence is profoundly felt.In light of these experiences, one can't help but yearn for a simple solution: a PXC-550 reimagined with USB-C. Such a proposition seems a minor ask for the return of what was lost—the instant gratification and reassurance of effortlessly powering down by folding, a feature that made the PXC-550 an indispensable part of life's arsenal.One could say that the new headphones, while technologically superior, miss the mark on understanding the rhythm of life. The joy of technology is not just in its capability but in its ability to blend seamlessly into our lives, enhancing without complicating. The previous model understood this, becoming more than just a tool for listening—it was a companion in the epic battle of everyday life.As it stands, despite its technological strides, the newer model leaves something to be desired for those of us who cherish both the journey and the simplicity of interaction with our gadgets. In essence, the quest for improvement should not forsake the intuitive pleasures of the past.Btw 80 seconds a day with this button nonsense, equals to 8 hours a years of frustration.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AF3JMHEBBABMCAMCXQHQBEXC2ONQ,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R246JYYUL9YOYE,B0B6GHW1SX,"4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing battery life, sound quality, and ANC.",Joseph Oscar,4,"I've figured out the bug people seem to run into which is the headset does not output sound. They're onand connected but no music. In my case, it's when an app. is activated for VOIP. I'm currently using the Nextiva phone app to answer calls when I walk away from the desk and when I receive a phone call, I have to force close the app to get music rolling again. Once music is playing, I can open the app again to catch the next call. It's a buggy back and forth but I have it figured out at least. Current phone is Google Pixel 7 Pro. So if anyone else reads this, try force closing whatever secondary app you use for VOIP.I just wanted the main issue to be the first eye catcher but with the headphones working and the equalizer set from the app, these things rock. If I'm working on a car with the ANC turned on, I can barely hear the air compressor running in the background. A little but it's reduced significantly. Now the ear cup material will make you sweat if your in a warm environment so make sure your aware of that. It's not that bad really. I'm sure when it gets warmer out, it will be more noticable. Probably not a good workout headphone either. That I can't comment on. I have to many excuses to go to the gym 😅.Battery life is great. Rated 60+ hours and it definitely is there. I use my headset daily with ANC moving all over the place with whatever I'm doing and music running all kinds of volume levels. I definitely don't charge these very often but get over a week depending on usage. 4-8 hours a day thoughout the work week.Sometimes, the in ear sensor that tells when the headset is on will think I've removed the headset and turn off. I'll just have to push the right side head cup in and it will read again and turn back on. Kind of annoying but I think I need to reach out to Sennheiser about that.Fingure controls, super easy and very responsive. Once you've used the headphones a few times and read the instruction sticker that comes on the headphones, it's muscle memory from there. Your off doing your own thing swiping, pinching and pressing your fingers around using the functions. Pretty easy.","Reviewed in the United States April 25, 2024",AH7R67SDE64QVCVJDKXGLLVZBPVQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R5KYHT6DTO7QB,B0B6GHW1SX,"3.0 out of 5 stars Almost ""The Ones"" for me that is.",CP,3,"Read on and you'll understand why I reviewed it this way.... My goal was to find the best sounding wireless headphones that were fairly priced after watching 50 hours of video reviews. With a Prime Day price tag around $250 these Momentum 4's were well worth the purchase. I'm going to say that they just aren't gong to work for me because I also purchased a pair of Focal Bathy's ($699), and a pair of Bower's and Wilkin's Px7S2e in the awesome color Blue at ($249) to compare them with. The Momentum 4's functionality is great but they just sound a bit thick, and less refined. This after listening to the others. And they are pretty non from a fashion perspective which I viewed personally as a plus. They are great if you have larger ears! Moving onto the others. After purchasing the Focal Bathy's I quickly came to realize that they were not the headphones that I was going to walk around town wearing. They are on the larger side, and present with some flashiness. That aside though, they are absolutely awesome sounding and BLOW AWAY the Momentum 4's. So if that's the comparison you're looking for, then there is your answer. I am keeping them as my ""reference"" wireless headphones. And with the cabled DAC connectivity it's a no brainer! Not even a second thought. Well maybe. For just a moment that happened after I listened to the Px7S2e cans and thought about the price difference. They, the Px7S2e headphones are absolutely pleasurable to listen to. The sound stage is remarkable, really really. And at ($249) on Prime Day they were certainly the best electronics purchase that I had made in years. I also think that they be worth it at full price. Smaller than both the others and with a build quality and design that warrants the full price. Also worth noting is that I did listen to the Bose UC's and I am intrigued by the spacial audio feature and the overall, well almost weightlessness of the headphones. They just weren't priced well enough for me to justify purchasing them and aside from their dominance in the noise cancellation department they just review as ""pretty good"" on sound quality. I would say to me they sounded on par with the Momentum 4's. I don't get too caught up in the ""app"" features as they can drastically improve with one update. I will mention that none had me shaking my head in either direction. And lastly, this journey all started with a pair of refurbished AirPods Max headphones. It made sense since I am in the Apple ecosystem. However I was very surprised at how uncomfortable they were as soon as I put them on my head. I was like wow, really. I felt as though they were going to dent my big head. LOL. I did like the ""crown control dial"" quite a bit I have to say. If you're shopping for wireless headphones and you stayed with me here you should just keep in mind that deciding on speakers and headphones is so very subjective from a sound perspective. We all hear a bit differently. You'll know it when you put ""THE"" pair on, raise your eyebrows, and say WOW. Fashion statements are a whole other sub topic. AND if you're thinking what about the Sony XM5's, all I'm going to say is that I am turned off by the over functionality of the Sony apps. From their cameras to their headphones and beyond. The end.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2024",AE23O75IIZVYP34WJST2EBUB4KXA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones
R38QYC50V9S55Y,B0B6GHW1SX,5.0 out of 5 stars Winner of my search for headphones,Chip chipperson,5,"I wanted to find a really good set of over the ear headphones to use at the office and for general use. I tried a few other highly rated models at varying price points. The momentum 4 was the winner for me. I had been using Beats Studio noise canceling earbuds and before that a pair of beats special edition solos. The solos hurt my ears after 2 hours, while the earbuds were great, but they just don’t last long enough for my current work environment without having to charge. Additionally, the earbuds had bad sound wuality for the microphones so they weren’t ideal for phone and teams calls.I orders the sennheiser as my higher end option to evaluate. At first I was a little skeptical of they were going to be the ones. I found that just pairing them to my iPhone worked and was easy, but it did t allow me to use the sennheiser app. I cleared them from my phones Bluetooth lost and paired again using the app, and all was good. The app offers a pretty decent amount of customization and guides you through it. I think the app works well once you get it all configured correctly. There are other headphones on the market that will really rattle your head with bass such as the beats and some of the skullcandy headphones. I found that I don’t care for those headphones when I’m listening to podcasts or audiobooks, they are just too tuned for music with deep and solid bass. The momentum 4 delivers some very tight and punch bass. I can’t say I’m wow’d by the bass I get for every track I listen to, but when I get into a bass heavy track or album, I find myself completely wow’d by the performance and range of these momentum 4’s. I believe these are a truer representation of how most songs are actually recorded. The clarity, crisp, clean, tight, punchy, deep, and full sound from these headphones is fantastic. I think my podcasts sound great, music sounds awesome, across a very wide variety of genres. The clarity of my voice in a loud office setting to take phone calls and teams calls is great. The noise canceling is always on unless you adjust to transparency to some degree, and I would have expected this to hinder battery life, but these do a great job canceling ambient noise and fully live up to the claims of 60plus hours of use between charges.I wear these at a minimum 6 hours a day, sometimes as much as 10. They actually keep a connection far better than I expected. I have these paired to my work pc and my iPhone at the same time and can get up and move around our office and leave devices at my desk and never lose connection. While connected to two devices it does a good job seamlessly transitioning from one device to the other based on what apps or programs you are running.Last thing I can think to comment on are the headphone controls. The right earpiece is a touch sensitive pad that picks up on specific but very intuitive gestures. Pausing music, changing tracks, adjusting ANC and transparency, and volume is super easy. The only one of these I think is a little touchy is the volume control, which works fine but it seems a little inconsistent as to how much it adjusts each time. I’ve never had a situation where it was too sensitive and blasted me with sound unexpectedly.Overall, I do recommend these for the money. Like mine so well, I bought a pair for my wife as she was so impressed with mine as well.","Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2024",AEHRRPY3SLGEJSCWGWWY75QNAMUQ,True,6,Color: WhiteStyle: OriginalPattern: Headphones

Highly recommend for those 3 kid single moms who don't want to hear micky mouse club house no more. I mean being able to click that aware button though and interact with them when necessary is pretty golden. Definitely get to know your settings and where your EQ is located and play around with your settings because I definitely don't listen to a good jam with drums and bass at the same settings as I would some, pink floid, jamiroquai, sia, morgan wailen. You could but you don't have to, you can change em with the touch of a quick button. Slick.

R1BS7PY9NIRGOX,B0CCZ26B5V,5.0 out of 5 stars Really amazing,frankfrank,5,"I have had lots of $40-60 headphones in my life and a few that did noise cancelling, and these blow them all out of the water by a huge margin.If you have some music on and noise cancelling enabled you will absolutely not hear your kids/wife in the same room unless they yell very loudly or happen to speak sharp/loud/quick at a perfect break in the music. These should be more heavily marketed to fathers everywhere to allow them to get 30 minutes of peace after work. Even without the music on it still blocks out as much noise as an average set of shooting earmuffs.In the ""aware"" mode you'll hear everything in your life just as good as you would with a single headset off your ear and the other one on, playing music.The bluetooth works great, connecting to multiple devices (phone and PC etc) at once with no foolish rules/policies that make it annoying.The other reviewers saying you have to have an app to use these are definitely wrong. You can install the app if you want extra features but you can also just pair it to your phone/tablet/pc like any other device and use it as-is. That's exactly what I did and it works great with all the standard features you would expect.Excellent hardware/buttons etc:- L side button switches between NC and ""aware"" mode, great feature to have in an easy to hit button- R side main button: single tap pauses whatever is playing, double tap jumps to next song, triple tap goes back- R side volume up and separate volume down buttons intuitively located- On button is also slide-and-hold for pairing: great feature that is impossible to do accidentally- USB-C charging- port to use hardwire cable to connect directly if you cannot understand the blueteeth thing or want to play something from a device that has no bluetooth or won't pair.Favorite feature: plug in the 2' hardwire cable (which has a tiny but good inline mic on it) and let it dangle or tuck in a shirt pocket: you now have a top quality, silent, noise cancelling headset with a good mic (without changing any mode, hitting buttons etc) that allows you to talk on the phone in bliss. Now instead of yelling at my kids to be quiet every 5 minutes that I'm on the phone, I just put these on and have a great phone call.In the small house that we live in these have made my life a lot better and allow me to let my kids run around loudly having fun at times when I just want some quiet, and when I would have otherwise made them tone it down.The only downside to know about is that these are effective enough to where you need to be careful not to use the noise cancelling when you have much going on that you need to pay attention to. For example: you would not hear your sink overflowing or a pot boiling over, I didn't hear my woodstove fire getting too hot the other day, you won't hear early warnings of kids having trouble (probably wouldn't hear choking etc but would still notice actual screaming nearby). You would still hear something break or a loud whack etc, but probably wouldn't hear a vehicle pull up in your driveway. It does to some extent take away a major ""sense"" so you can't use it as often as you might like.For those other times, like if your wife is cooking and can hear the kids for you if there is trouble, and you just want to relax, I feel like I would almost pay the purchase price of these per week that I got to use them it is so awesome.","Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2024",AHXY35FZ3NHNVNYNIINCKSNQ3G7Q,True,45,Color: Black

I immediately notice that the Bose is FAR SUPERIOR in noise canceling and quality. In the cheaper pairs, I noticed some type of 'air pressure' in my ear that the noise canceling was producing. My guess is it was some kind of standing wave to mask/hide external noise. I really don't know, because I'm not educated in this specific technology. However, I do know for sure that when I put the Bose on, I don't notice anything except the external world noises completely vanishing without a trace. Also because the Bose pair doesn't have some weird air pressure masking/hiding external noises, I can hear the music better, louder, and clearer than the other pairs.Overall just very impressed with the stark difference in quality. In some cases, cheaper is better because you can't really tell the difference.

I can walk for 5 days - a few miles a day and still have battery power left at the end of the week. The only feature I have not used yet is the microphone adapter.Downsides are basically expense and aesthetics. I am an old man and am used to using headphones rather than earbuds.

These were my second pair in two months. I had the same problem with both of them. I returned the first ones. When I connected to my ipad, I couldn't also connect to another device; otherwise, it would crackle and pop even when I wasn't listening to anything. Then, when I would listen to certain songs even at high quality via youtube, it would crackle even more. Most of the time, the sound was fine, but the few times during the day that it would keep crackling, was disappointing. I'm glad I got the extended warranty. I tried all of the steps they said to take, and none of it made a difference. I'll be returning these. I have a pair of Soundcore Q45s and have had no problems with them, and they cost $100 less.

The headphones themselves are good quality and sound really good. I love that there is a ""quiet"" button that cancels the noise and an ""aware"" that lets you continue to hear your music and the outside world. What I am not happy with is that the second time I used the case the zipper split and it won't open and close. I contacted their customer service on Facebook because I heard this was the fastest route. They basically said, ""well we are out of those so click notify me and then you can order some."" When I replied to them and said they were brand new and I felt like they should supply a new case at their expense, they replied, ""I understand that I.., but at this time, I do not have an estimated date on when we are expecting the next shipment of the carry case. I do recommend you use the 'notify me' button on the product page as mentioned previously, and when they do come available, you can drop us a message here, and we will be happy to assist you. That was a month ago. It just feels like they should have put me on the list to get me a new case, not sit around waiting, jumping through hoops for a case.

I live near some warehouses that constantly have tractor trailers coming in and out and the noise cancellation has been a godsend for me. My current ones are getting old and looking their age so I decide to get a new one. These or even better than my old ones. They’re easy to use. I can actually set where I want the noise cancellation for different levels. Also, it’s very easy to answer my phone and talk to people while I’m listening to audiobooks. That was the only disadvantage to my old pair I could never get them to answer the phone. This one just does it with the flick of my finger on the little button on the one headphone. People say they are really expensive but to me you get what you pay for and I will gladly pay for these.

I can actually hear my surroundings or if someone's trying to get my attention at work. Noise cancellation mode is pretty good too for things like yard work or whatever also.They were an impulse buy but I'm a huge fan now.I should also mention they're incredibly lightweight.

R2V6Q4TZIQ2ILC,B0CCZ26B5V,5.0 out of 5 stars HOLY MOLY !!!,V,5,"if you're in the market for noise-cancelling headphones then I suggest these! Bose is what we use at the private aircraft manufacturer I work at for the headsets in all the planes. The brand itself is fudging awesome and reliable as a son of a gun. Their main focus is sound quality and background noise cancellation. I've had Beats solos (club editions, solo 3, and Beats Pro earbuds), JBL (earbuds and headphones), and I've used several other brands claiming they're the best. Music is obviously very important to me, and I'm part-time in a home office, so I use headphones for meetings and videos. The only thing I could possibly nit-pick about them is that the Beats solo 3s have a much longer battery life, but these do last all day!! And they fully charge within 8 hours MAX. Also, they come with an AUX cord, so you can connect them to your compatible devices without Bluetooth! Recently, I bought the Bose QC 45 headphones in moonstone blue (color doesn't affect the quality of sound or anything but HOLY MOLY IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL), and HOLY CRAP!! They're worth every cent, I swear by them! I slip these bad boys on (no audio) and my fan (on high) TV (on 10-15/40-50), and all chatter and other background noises get wiped out immediately. It feels like your ears get plugged. (My dad and younger sister said the same!) When you play something in them it's crisp and clean-cut audio, and you can forget about hearing anything else with them on. I'm absolutely flabbergasted, that's why I'm putting y'all on these!! The Sony WH1000s are overrated like a son of a gun. If you're gonna pay $350 for any headphones, I'm begging you to make it these!!! I'm beyond happy, and I'm so glad I decided to buy these.

What I mean by that, is my boyfriend mixes music, and while these are high quality this review isn’t for those types of people. This is for more layperson type of needs.1. I actually used chat gpt to compare and contrast numerous headphones based on my desires so if you’re needing help choosing that was very helpful to me.2. My needs were as follows: light, comfortable, noise cancelling, color, Bluetooth across devices, and ease of app use.3. I discovered that these headphones outdo their Sony competition specifically because they’re lighter and they don’t drop Bluetooth when you move to your computer from your phone for example. I found Sony has issues trying to switch back to your phone when on computer.Bluetooth is very important to me and a top need. I switch between devices enough for that to be a serious issue for me.4. I have a tiny head and am a 5’2 woman. I don’t have large proportions. For example my boyfriend is 6 foot with a large head and headphone weight won’t affect him the same way. For me headphones can literally be too heavy and fatiguing so my other main qualifier was that these are lighter than all but 1 of the top 7 brands out there.5. The cushion on these is shockingly luxurious and an added bonus.6. I get a mean case of sensitive ears, I always have. When I run my ears ache, in the cold my ears ache, if I am in a plane they ache. I am part of a certain population percentage (I’ve googled it’s around 30% but fact check me- this is for you though if you are like me) who have ear canals that actually can be very painful with the wrong pressure. For this reason I’m fairly picky about headphones which apply a significant amount of pressure. These headphones have not triggered this issue for me.7. I wanted good plane headphones and these will be great if I lean my head on the window area. The band doesn’t dig.8. They look really nice.9. The color options are cute10. The case is nice11. I heard for Sony there was popping on phone calls and it therefore became between these and Apple however apples are very very heavy. I ended up going with these for that reason. I have used them for numerous phone calls and haven’t had the issues, and people hear me easily and have had no issues hearing me. I did have popping once but I think it’s on the end of the person you’re on the phone with. My cousin was in his car shouting into his Bluetooth and I feel if he had been quieter it wouldn’t have happened. The popping has never occurred with music and is specific to a loud shout from someone on their own CarPlay so no biggie. Otherwise zero pop12. The noise cancelling is exceptional, I put them on and don’t play anything, but can no longer hear my AC at all. You understand generally the sound of constant AC. Like vrrrrrrrrr. It’s completely gone.13. Soothing without music to just make things less loud. Suitable for autistics who want a quieting incognito headphone that changes, also more comfy than alternative ear covers. (I am AuDHD.)14. Music can get really loud and nice lots of depth (layerperson opinion but my boyfriend said the sound quality is great and the next step up is just studio mixing headphones)15. If you wait for prime day or other sales they’re 150$ off usually (better than every other competitors prime or Black Friday deals)16. They seem durable and collapse in many ways so you can’t easily break them.17. The app has had no issues for me. Online there’s some app complaints and I have not run into them at all. The app seems to me very easy to navigate.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AENHF6YD4RSLEPKBFSQZK3DE3LBA,True,38,Color: White
R1CKN589J52EL5,B0CCZ26B5V,5.0 out of 5 stars Quiet and (mostly) comfortable indeed.,Reviewer MHM 3-5,5,"This is my first pair of Bose headphones. Initial impressions before even putting them on was “Dang, these are expensive headphones,” and at $349.99, yes, they are. There’s hundreds of headphones on the market, many of them with noise cancelling, that are available for far less money. But, considering my first pair of ANC Headphones were the original Beats by Dr. Dre Studios, and adjusted for inflation since 2011, I paid $416 for those, these are certainly more than competitive. Also, there’s a reason that for the past several years, when people bring up noise cancelling headphones, they are usually talking about Sony or Bose as their reference point. They are quality. They do the job well. Let’s dive in.1. ANC2. Comfort3. Sound4. Build Quality5. Feature Set6. Who should buy these?Ok, so as I said, my previous ANC Headphones are the original Beats Studios, and my most recent over the ear headphones purchase was the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x back in 2017. I’ll be comparing these to my experience with the both of them. Maybe also in comparison to my gaming headset, the Razer Barracuda X.First off, the noise cancelling itself, since this lineup is called QUIETComfort. Pretty darn good. Honestly, I can’t say that it’s any better than my reference point of headphones from 2011, but still positive experience. Blocks out basically all voices (except the higher range like baby cries), and I couldn’t hear any other noise around me when in use. Can’t complain.Now for the QuietCOMFORT portion of the equation. Compared to both of my previous headphones, it’s a serious improvement. The Beats and Audio-Technica both were heavy over the top of my skull, creating discomfort over extensive sessions where I would shift the band forward and backward over my head to give a break to the affected area. My Razer Barracuda X are also lightweight, and up to this point were the most comfortable in this regards, but the Bose definitely have more padding on the band. That said, I still have experienced the same over the skull discomfort with these headphones, and the band has to be loosened to address it. Obviously, that means the headphones overall sit more loosely on my head and are less secure.The earcups have sufficient padding for my ears, and they don’t make contact, so though they are shallow, they aren’t as shallow as others I’ve owned where the speaker housings press against the outer cartilage of my ear. This, again makes for a comfortable experience over time. Like other headphones I’ve owned, definitely heat buildup inside the earcups, and these are no exception, with condensation gathering on the material. Yep, I was sweaty listening to these. But I live in the desert, so there’s that. Your experience may vary based on your location and if you run generally warm or not.The sound quality over playback is pleasant, and anything I’ve found unpleasant I can adjust easily with the Bose app to tune the EQ to my liking. I blame anything I haven’t liked to my various EQ settings (iOS, Spotify, Bose app combinations) and the source of the audio (Spotify streaming) more than the quality of the sound itself. Both my ATH-M50x and Barracuda X have mostly neutral sound, with the ATH being legitimate studio monitors being only slightly warm and the Barracuda having neutral with slight emphasis to bass for obvious reasons: gaming you want to hear footsteps, and higher bass emphasis aids immersion in game. Obviously, the Beats were very warm, and had bass emphasized beyond the Barracudas. So if I were to place the Bose in the comparison, I’d say its default sound is warm, not neutral, but definitely not as bass heavy as anything Beats put out in 2011 (and from what I read, remains bass heavy in the present). These aren’t studio monitors or reference headphones or audiophile headphones. They’re meant to just make your music sound good with little fuss, with the ability to tune to your liking. If you want audiophile headphones, neither Bose nor Sony nor Beats offerings in this segment meet that criteria. If you want bass heavy headphones, Bose, Sony, JBL have extensive options in that regards at several price points. As already stated, this meets the middle ground between neutral and bass emphasized. It’s warm out of the box, but not at the detriment of the rest of the range. Everything from low to high is clear and crisp. Nothing is overly harsh.Build quality is a little bit of a concern of mine. It’s very hard to find a set of headphones not made entirely out of plastic and no exception here. The inherent design of my OG Beats, though also loaded with plastic, felt sturdier, but the only moving points on those were the hinges, and to a far lesser degree, the cups moved on slight swivels to lay flat on your head. So it makes sense that they’d feel sturdy when there wasn’t a lot of pivot and rotation points. On these, the headphones have folding and rotating ear cups, and at all points across the build, there feels like there’s flex in it. I worry very much that my toddler or baby would get a hold of them and twist them to pieces. I don’t have that concern with either my Audio-Technica headphones, also mostly plastic, nor the Corsair gaming headset my toddler uses for his drum kit, which gets tossed around, stepped on, kicked around, and keeps on going just fine. But, as previously stated, the material choice keeps weight down, which keeps comfort high, like my Barracuda X. Both have lots of lightweight plastic. Both need to be kept away from kids that don’t know how to treat things with delicate touch. Though I know people do go for a run or workout with these, I wouldn’t recommend it. I don’t know if they’d survive a fall, and they’re not IPX rated anyhow against sweat or other moisture. Seriously, get some IPX rated headphones or use some earbuds for sweaty, motion filled sessions. Keep these for the office, study, travel, and everyday listening. With that said, these still feel like a premium product. They don’t feel cheap. I’m just leveling with anyone that is considering these of what their limitations may be.Feature set for these is quite extensive, and y’all can do your research on every last bit. Will just point out some things I was curious about when I purchased these.- The ANC has two presets: Quiet and Aware. You can craft your own presets in the app, and adjust them based on your liking and whether or not you think you’ll encounter wind. So far I find these basically pointless. I don't need to fine tune how much ANC I have. I either want to hear things, or don't.- The app also supports any firmware updates and allows you to tune your EQ to your liking. I can’t stand that there’s multiple Bose apps. I use one for these headphones and one for my Soundlink Flex. I really wish Bose would consolidate all their consumer, portable audio (meaning headphones, earbuds, and travel speakers) into one app. I don’t know why I need two apps for devices that both come and go with me. I’d be more forgiving of multiple apps along portable products versus home products (such as in-wall speakers and home theater speakers). It's especially confusing when the Soundlink Flex MAX is in the Bose Music app with the QuietComforts, but the Soundlink Flex is not. So weird, so pointless. Anyhow, I digress.- Like all QC lineups, these headphones also support analog playback over a traditional cable. They also all feature an asymmetric plug arrangement, 2.5mm on one end and 3.5mm on the other. Unlike the more expensive QuietComfort Ultras, this pair of headphones I’m reviewing allows for passive playback. If you run out of charge or are preserving charge, you can still use these without ANC and listen over the cable. And it has in-line mic as well. This gives you far more flexibility than the Ultras, and allows these headphones to serve double duty as an in-a-pinch gaming headset for an Xbox controller, and to continue to support phone calls, etc. through the in-line microphone even if you cannot or choose not to power them on. I cannot believe that Bose’s flagship product, the Ultras, do not offer that same versatility. This product would be even better if you could use these speakers powered but without ANC features (quiet or aware) enabled to conserve battery power, but retain the convenience of wireless.- Driver size is 35mm to the Ultras 40mm. My ATH-M50x, aptly named, are closer to 50mm drivers, and I believe the Barracuda X are 40mm or so. But the playback volume on the Bose seems louder and, obviously is more versatile than my analog only ATH-M50x comparison. The Barracuda, also wireless, are still less versatile in that they require the USB-C dongle or the analog cable to function, and lack ANC. Bluetooth 5+ is just far more versatile, even if it has latency that the aforementioned devices do not.- Main differences between these and the Ultras include the driver size (Ultra is larger), the amount of microphones used for ANC (the Ultra has more), the inclusion of Immersive Audio on the Ultras (like Spatial Audio on Apple… I’m honestly not sold by that at this time), battery life (these are longer than the Ultra), and the physical structure of them differ. These are just another rehash of the QC35, QC45 design, the Ultras are unique in their structure.They arrived at 60% charge and I listened to them for about 30 minutes before placing them on a USB-C charger. Within an hour I was at 100%. Could’ve been quicker. Idk. Was in the backyard playing with the kiddos and listening to the Bose Soundlink Flex (go buy one of those, I’d recommend that to anybody).So, who are these headphones for? A lot of people, but let’s face it, $349.99 will price out a lot of buyers. I’d recommend my existing ATH-M50x to people that want to spend under $200 and only care about reliable sound. I’d recommend Sony ULT ANC Headphones for people with $200 to spend that want ANC and plan on listening to Pop, Hip-Hop, EDM (their ANC is nearly as good as XM5, Sony’s competitor to these Bose… but they’re very bass heavy). I’d recommend Audio-Technica again to people with a budget of $100.These are a luxury product. I’m aware that there are headphones far more expensive than these. But these are still expensive to many people. At this price point, I’d expect no less than 5 years of usage, and as I’ve already stated, I’ve used $150 headphones for 7 years now. So with that said, a couple of points of advice to someone weighing investing into these:- These go on sale periodically down to $249.99. At that price, they’re still premium, but far more competitive against the likes of Sony XM5 and Apple AirPods Max.- Bose Refurbished is a great option. The warranty is exactly the same as the brand new product, and you save money. I’ve done just that with my Soundlink Flex and have been so happy. I’m doing it again with the QuietComfort Ultras, which I snagged at $259.99, instead of their new list price of $429.99.Okay, enough money talk. Back to who these are for. If you made it this far, the $249.99-$349.99 is obviously something you’re considering as a fair value.So with that said, if you are a professional or student that wants to block out the noise around you for hours on end so you can work, these are for you.If you use public transport and want headphones to help you escape the noise, these are for you. Just, uh, be aware of your surroundings. Ya know, be safe. Yadda yadda.If you want legendary ANC, comfort, sound quality as you go through the airport and on your plane, these are for you.If you want some good headphones for the gym, I’d say you won’t be disappointed, but I’d encourage you to do some research for other headphones before you make a plan to routinely sweat into or potentially toss about headphones that are not made for either.If you’re the type of parent that wants to spoil your kid with great headphones, I’d say keep looking unless you find your child as responsible and respectful as a grown adult. I would certainly have broken these as a kid, and maybe even as a teen out of negligence (i.e. tossing my loaded backpack around or something and accidentally smashing something inside or nearby, hard case or not). There are many great headphones out there for less money, and some that are more sturdy. If you want to bless your child that way, do some serious research first, amongst serious review websites that breakdown sound quality, build quality, etc.Wow, look at you! You made it through my Amazon novel! I mean review. Yeah, that's what I meant. Hope it gave you some things to think about as you find the perfect headphones for you. That Cypress Green sure looks good though, right? Ok, bye bye bye now.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AH5F7QHDE5VKRAMBN43A5WPU4ADQ,True,411,Color: Cypress Green

As someone who values high-quality audio and effective noise cancellation, these headphones have truly impressed me.First and foremost, the noise-cancelling feature is phenomenal. Whether I’m on a busy commute, working in a noisy café, or just trying to relax at home, the Bose QuietComfort headphones create an incredibly serene listening environment. The active noise cancellation technology blocks out external sounds so effectively that it feels like I’m in my own private sound bubble.The sound quality is top-notch as well. The audio is crisp, clear, and well-balanced across all genres. Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the clarity and richness of the sound make every experience enjoyable.Comfort is another area where these headphones truly shine. The plush ear cushions and adjustable headband ensure a perfect fit for extended listening sessions. I’ve worn them for hours on end without any discomfort, which is a testament to their ergonomic design.Battery life is impressive, too. I easily get up to 24 hours of playback on a single charge, making them ideal for long flights, commutes, or extended work sessions. And if you’re in a pinch, a quick charge gives you hours of additional listening time.The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and reliable. Pairing with my devices is quick and hassle-free, and the connection stays strong even when I’m moving around.Overall, the Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones are worth every cent.

Used to burn through cheaper ($100-$150 range) headphones so feel like this model is the right price to save money over time.I use these at work everyday. They block out enough noise and coffee shops and airplanes to allow you to actually watch a movie or make a call if you need to without the dialing the volume to 11. Onboard mic works well enough - no one on other end has commented on issues.I’m not an audiophile who geeks out on speaker quality, but I feel like these get the job done. I listen to a very eclectic mix of music in Spotify and I feel like the audio quality holds up between dubstep and light classical. Probably not good enough for a pro musician but more than enough for a tech bro to listen to synthwave and get into a flow-state.As long as BOSE can maintain this level of quality I’ll keep gifting this quiet comfort model to loved ones.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AHMHOXH3CWWGXYTBHAUO2RA66YTQ,True,13,Color: Moonstone Blue

ROG20CQUWLEBQ,B0CCZ26B5V,"4.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful sound quality, somewhat flimsy",VM Express,4,"I've had these Bose QuietComfort NC Headphones for about a month now, and I really like how they feel and sound. For context, I have tried out about 5 different pairs in the last 6 years, starting with some Plantronics PRO's back in 2017, which i still use occasionally for travel. Then I moved to some Sony ones which I did not like. All of these other headphones were wireless and noise cancelling in the $100 to $150 range. They each had some shortfall that made them hard to use. Honestly out of all my previous headphoen the Plantronics were the best in quality and durability and Battery life. Sony always had connectivity issues and would crash randomly. Even the mid range model WHCH710N which had a lot of issues. They would randomly crash during zoom calls or listening to music. Happened about 3-4 times a week, it was getting really annoying.I decided to tier up my headphones because I use them for work daily. I thought it was a worth while investment. I decided to go with Bose because of the name recognition and because I have seen many of my peers use them (Im a Software Engineer).My first impressions of the Bose headphones were :- Light- Easy to setup - reliable bluetooth connection (something Sony was lacking)- Excellent sound quality (Best sound quality - on par and slightly better than my Plantronics)- Comfortable (The most comfortable out of all the other headphones I've used)To elaborate further. A common pain point I've experienced is difficulty pairing and dealing with unstable bluetooth connections with my other headphones. I rightfully assumed that this was a price point issue, because I have not had that problem with the Bose headphones. The Bose headphones were easy to setup, they also have apps to help with it. But you can use them without any apps.They are very comfortable and fairly light, comparing to others i've used. I sometimes wear these for 6-10 hours a day and I never have that weird ear pain that you can develop from wearing headphones for long. I have very big ears so that is saying something.Sound quality is excellent. Deep bass with excellent sound range, very satisfying to listen to. They also have a great volume range. This is what Bose is known for so they definitely get this right.CON 1:They do feel rather flimsy. For this price point I expected more metal parts. The materials look well made and have excellent form factor. The headphones however are completely plastic from what I can tell. I feel like one good tug would snap the hinges on the ear pieces. This is a serious concern when you're wearing lose clothing or a hoodie. The headphone could get caught in the folds of your clothing and if were to pull hard or fast while going through the motions you might break them. I have no data to back this up obviously because I am not going to throw away perfectly good headphones to test that theory but you can sort of tell by holding them and pulling on them a little.CON 2:Battery life isn't great. If I forget to turn them off at the end of my work day they somehow continue to deplete the battery. The following morning they are already at 50% battery. So that is 50% a day with only 6-8 hours of actual work (active use). For reference, my old Plantronics headphones last for several days without needing a recharge. I have gone on to use them for 5+ days without having to charge them. Even the mid-range Sony headphones perform ""slightly"" better than this. I know it's good practice to turn them off after you're done but one forgets to do that far more often than one would think. There is room for improvement here.Overall i'd say these are excellent headphones with great sound quality and form factor. Do take a little extra care because they are not the most durable headphones out there. I am happy with. mySummary:PROS: Sound Quality, Comfort, Weight, Form Factor, Easy Setup, Reliable Bluetooth ConnectionCONS: Battery Life, Durability","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AHKNGYT2K6K5PWJHXZVS3MRFAEMA,True,59,Color: Black
R2Q5DR459SZ1O4,B0CCZ26B5V,5.0 out of 5 stars Best overall noise cancelling headphones on the market.,Jackson Stublar,5,"These headphones are great, I’ve tested the four of the most popular pairs of over ear noise canceling headphones and these are my brief take aways:This pair of Bose: Great sound and noise cancellation, long battery life, they fold down to a great size, and the color is perfect. I also like that they have a physical on switch and sound buttons, this makes switching between devices far easier and is a great added convenience. One downside is the lack of automatic pausing when you take them off.Sony XM 5: The gold standard in sound and noise cancelation. I had them for a year and a half before switching to this pair of Bose. The only reason behind this is the portability. The XM 5 do not fold so the storage form factor is quite inconvenient. But if this is not an issue for you I would suggest them over Bose. My only other gripe with these is the on/off switch being a button and the lack of physical buttons for volume and pausing. This pair of Bose are far superior in this category.Sony XM 4: Also great sound and noise cancellation plus they fold down. However I give the slight edge to the Bose.AirPod Max: These are quite popular but I have never been a fan. They do not fit as well as the others, they’re very heavy, you are limited on use with non Apple devices, they don’t have an on switch, and they have many other quirky flaws. Their strongest upside is the great transparency mode, however I wouldn’t consider that the driving factor in the noise cancelling headphone market.All in all, I find this pair of Bose to be the best overall product on the market. They are the most convenient option in terms of daily use while having strong technical specs. However, if you are looking purely for the best specs and the convenience and travel functionality do not impact you, the XM 5 may be the way to go.","Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2024",AEITW3U5WZCIL4EE6Q6VK53ZTPJQ,True,64,Color: Cypress Green

It took a while to wrap my head around all its features, but once I figured it out, I LOVED IT. I paired the them with both my PC and iPhone, and the accompanying app is awesome, allowing me to connect to both devices simultaneously. This feature is a real game changer, making it so much easier to switch between my PC and phone without any hassle.The noise cancellation is comparable to my AirPods, but these headphones make it much easier to coordinate between devices, especially my PC. The sound quality is excellent, and the comfort level is top-notch, even during long listening sessions. The build quality feels premium, and the controls are intuitive once you get used to them.I was on the fence about purchasing these headphones since they are on the pricier side, but I'm glad I bought them.

RTOEPK2F01IIV,B0CCZ26B5V,"4.0 out of 5 stars Bose is, as usual, worth the (on sale) price",Miss History,4,"There's just something about Bose quality and design. These headphones are perfect if you're looking for good sound quality, excellent noise cancelling, and--maybe most importantly for me--comfort. I don't know how they did it, but these really are crazy comfy to wear. They have a snug fit to boost sound quality and noise blocking, but they aren't tight at all and have a very nice, cushiony feel. I inevitably get headaches from wearing any other over-ear headphones for very long, but I've gone hours with these on my head and almost forgotten they're even there. I also like that they're not super-duper big and ostentatious. I'm not looking to wear these as a loud fashion statement and I like how sleek they are as-is. And I love the way they fold up to fit in their nice little case. It's the least awkward folding-of-headphones I've seen so far.I'm not an aficionado when it comes to sound quality, but I can tell you from personal experience and preference that the quality on these is great. Not the best out there, since, hey, you're not paying $600+ for these, but excellent nonetheless for me. You do have to have the volume up a bit to get the really epic listening experience, but that's no different from other over-ear headphones I've owned. The connected app is a no-frills affair that lets you adjust the sound a bit to your liking, and you can create additional listening modes with your preferred EQ, but I've been happy with the as-is modes already programmed into it. Set up with the app was blessedly uneventful. It connected on the first try and I've never had a bit of trouble connected new devices to my headphones. Glorious.Let's talk noise-cancelling. When that switch is flipped, the world outside your headphones is gone. It doesn't feel unnatural like you're sitting in a vacuum, but it does let you happily escape all the noisy distractions around you and just enjoy whatever you're listening to at whatever volume you prefer. I have to formally announce to anyone else home that I'm putting my headphones on because, aside from physically touching me or doing some acrobatics in my direct line of sight, I can't hear them at all if they're trying to get my attention--which, obviously, I love. Kind of the point of noise cancelling, right?The design of the headphones is simple and to the point in terms of controls. The last two pair of headphones I owned before these had awkwardly placed buttons for volume and pausing. I would always fumble to find them even after owning them for years. The controls on these Bose headphones are somehow placed just perfectly, and my fingers land on them on the first try every time. It's a little thing since a lot of us use our phones or smart watches to change the song and what not, but when I really am immersed and want to leave all distractions aside, using the controls on the headphones is a nice little treat, and that lack of fumbling to find them goes a long way to allowing me to stay in that happy and calm little headspace.I want to give these five stars for the price I paid (which, btw, was a sale price of 249.99 USD), but there's a couple of small, intertwined drawbacks for me that puts them at between a 4 and 4.5: the battery life and the power toggle/slider. The battery life is, in a word, fine. My previous headphones went for weeks of sporadic, casual listening without me needing to charge them, but they weren't as fancy and they weren't noise-cancelling. These Bose headphones need fairly regular charging, which isn't the end of the world, especially since--I assume--they use up more battery thanks to the awesomely effective noise-cancelling. It will last a long airplane trip but you'll need to charge it pretty soon after that or else you're going to be sans-headphones for at least part of the flight home.Then there's the power toggle. In general, I love this little toggle/slider. It's nothing but a tiny, silly, minor inconvenience, but I'm not a fan of the hold-this-for-a-little-while power buttons that also double as the button you need to activate Bluetooth/Bluetooth pairing. I always feel like an idiot when it's time to pair a new device to it and I can't figure out if I need to triple press the power button or what. A nice, small and easily accessible toggle/slider to turn the headphones on and off? Fantastic.The downside? You sure as heck better remember to turn the headphones off when you're not using them or they're going to remain on until the battery dies. In my experience, with that all-powerful toggle there is no automatic powering off if you leave the headphones out of use for an extended period of time. It will just drain that battery until the headphones are dead. It's a simple solution--just remember to scoot that slider to off when you're done with them! But, lamentably, I'm super forgetful and easily distracted, and some of you might be the same. I've now accidentally left my headphones on three times, and even though it is my fault, I've been pretty bummed that my headphones are totally dead when I pull them out again after that moment of forgetfulness. The automatic powering off after inactivity in my previous headphones is the one feature that I really, really miss. Is this a dealbreaker? Would I go back to those headphones because of this? Absolutely not. But from one concerned, forgetful listener to another, just remember to manually power down, even if you think you're only going to be stepping away from your headphones for two seconds :)Would I buy these again? In a heartbeat, but I probably won't need to. I've had them for seven months now but, if they're anything like the Bose speakers I've owned, they're going to last me a lot longer yet. Would I pay the full 350 USD price for them? Maybe. I got mine on sale, and they were even cheaper during Prime Day 2024. They're an awesome set of headphones, but if the price is still a little steep for you, maybe add them to your list and keep an eye on it. Bose products tend to go on sale periodically for much better discounts than, say, Apple products, especially around the holiday season.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2024",AHVOHVELL2RNLNFZWLVM3UY2OH3A,True,0,Color: Black
RUR84RZ9061M0,B0CCZ26B5V,5.0 out of 5 stars ANC HEADPHONE COMPARISON: BOSE QUIETCOMFORT / 1MORE SONOFLOW / BEATS SOLO PRO / AIR PODS PRO,ITMCT,5,"I’ve owned & extensively used the Beats Solo Pros & Air Pods Pros. I gave the Beats to my daughter as the ‘on-the-ear’ design was causing me pain on flights. I migrated to the AirPods Pros hoping I’d get similar performance to the Beats with more comfort and less bulk on flights. Ultimately, the Air Pods Pros just won’t stay in my ears and the ANC just isn’t as effective due to the lack of ear covers or better plugs. So recently I ordered the new Bose QuietComforts and the 1More Sonoflows to compare. I was hopeful on the 1More product due to being on sale for $67 and that the price savings would outweigh any deficits. But ultimately I am going with the Bose QCs. This is my personal opinion and what works best for me. Keep in mind I have not extensively tested the Bose or 1More yet, but spent a day alternating between the two so this is based on initial impressions. Categories are in personal order of importance.COMFORT/DESIGN: I gave up the Beats due to pain/pressure from prolonged use of the on the ear cups. I am also not a fan of the Air Pods Pro design, nor getting them to fit in my ears well and stay (I love the original air pods, and I’ve tried multiple buds for the Pros). I have a large head so the Beats had to be fully extended to be on my head properly which probably increased pressure. They fit my adult daughter much better. The Bose QCs don’t require full extension on me, completely cover my ears, and the cups are really soft. The 1More product covers completely, and is comfortable, but heavier & puts more pressure around my ears than the Bose, so I’m skeptical if I’d want to wear them more than an hour or so. The pressure is a drawback especially given the ANC performance noted next.RANKING: Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > Beats SoloPro > Air Pods ProANC: In my immediate comparison of the Bose QCs and the 1More Sonoflow, there was a large difference in noise cancellation. I use an infrared heater in my office sometimes that is pretty noisy. Comparable to airplane noise but quieter. The Bose is very effective against it despite fitting looser than the 1More product. But the Bose has less options than the Beats for ANC modes and I found the Beats to be slightly better at full ANC than the Bose and quicker to switch modes. The Air Pods are at a disadvantage here being an earbud product but they are effective and travel light. The 1More product was the worst performer on ANC for me.RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Bose QuietComfort > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.SOUND/EQ/APP: I always found the Beats Solo Pros to be balanced, clear, dynamic and pleasant. Integrated with Apple, they worked great though many audiophiles will complain about the lack of EQ adjustments. I liked the simplicity of them and not having to have an additional app. Same goes for the Air Pods. The Bose Sound is very good, as you would expect from Bose, and their App is simple and ok. Out of the box very good and you can tune them to preference. The 1More Product out of the box is definitely at the bottom of the pile. It had an almost metallic, chunky, machine sound to me. You can adjust them, update firmware, and tune them with the app which made the largest difference in the performance compared to the others. The app did have a neat white noise feature with some different options. It also had twice as many EQ adjustments points over the Bose. Ultimately, I enjoy the Bose sound the most followed by the Beats and AirPods and then the 1More, but once tuned all are very good, especially if ANC with music or video on an airplane are your target use.RANKING: Bose QC > Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.PHYSICAL FUNCTIONALITY: For me, I love the Beats functionality. Buttons are intuitive and easy to use, typical tactile Apple design. AirPods are similar. So far the Bose is ok, it’s intuitive and the buttons seem like they will be easy to learn. The 1More Sonoflow is last here. All buttons on the right side, the power button in front doubles as a function button and for me it’s awkward trying to find it on the front. The 1More is last by a bit for me here.RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > Bose QC > 1More SonoflowCASE: Beats Case is cheap and not protective at all. AirPods are AirPods. The 1More Case fits but is a bit bulky, rounded, and the included accessory net is too small. The Bose Case is well made, stiff, protective, has a large accessory net, and is rectangular shaped. Personally I see it fitting in a carry on laptop bag or backpack much easier.RANKING: Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > AirPods Pro > Beats Solo ProBATTERY LIFE: This is of limited importance to me. But it seems to get tons of mention in every online review you read. The headphones all have insanely long run times compared to older devices. I always charge before a trip and never seem to end up with dead devices. Charge your stuff. Not that hard.","Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2024",AHDJUVOQFM3KYWPZVTOVBIJ7ADIA,True,115,Color: Cypress Green
R1VSABWBIXFJZI,B0CMZD8688,3.0 out of 5 stars Overall: Disappointing,Captain Geektoid,3,"Long story short:Not what I was expecting, and returning.Long Story long:So Last year my Fiance gifted me Beats Solo3 for my B-Day. I'm someone who loves to listen to music, and had been looking for some new headphones that would accompany a pair of Monster - Inspirations I've had for the past 10 years that are still going strong. Monster, you might remember, was the first company to produce Beats before they were bought by Apple. The Solo3's were PERFECT. I know they're not the most ""Audiophile"" pair of cans on the planet, but even Sennheiser's HD 800's need some sort of DAC to make them less...Flat sounding. And hey, if you like Flat and consider yourself a true audiophile...well first, I don't know why you'd be reading a review for Beats Studio Pro, and second, I mean good for you, listening to music like it was a 1920's Phonograph.Me, I personally favor boosted everything. Bass, Mids, Highs. And the Solo 3's were, hell, still are, amazing. No full DAC required. Everytime I plug in the 3.5mm cable and listen to Lossless audio on my home server, Gosh, I mean...they sound good streaming 320kbps AAC/MP3's over bluetooth, which is what MOST OF YOU will use them for, but LOSSLESS!? It makes me wet. I'm sorry.So enter the Studio Pro's. Got these for $169 on Prime Day. Busted these babies out, put them in AAANNND...boy, they are not like the Solo3's at all. I mean, connected via Bluetooth is fine. It's fine. They're fine. Any $75 dollar headset will perform well enough over bluetooth and give you comparable noise cancelling if you're looking for that. But these, at retail NOT ON SALE, are like $350...I expect MORE from that. The other reviews gushing about these led me to believe I'd be getting MORE from that. And, again, they're fine. It's fine. But not GREAT. And for $350 I expect them to be great. For $170 I expected them to be BETTER, and they just weren't. And that's just bluetooth...when I plugged them in via the USB-C cable AND the 3.5mm jack for lossless audio...boy the performance was not there. They were so much quieter than the Solo's, and nothing was as Punchy. In fact, they sounded kind of flat. But if I wanted flat, I'd get the Sennheiser's and like a $600 DAC or other sound mix board to plug directly into. And you know, I have a DAC. It's the $65 dollar Fiio BTR3K, which is actually a very nice portable device I've used with my Solo3's and in my car to get lossless audio in my car. It performs well for what it is. So I plugged the Studio Pro's into it and they instantly sounded superior. And, y'know, I probably wouldn't mind that at all if I was listening to music 8 hours a day through the DAC and with the headphones firmly on. But I'm not, at least not enough to justify even the heavily discounted price I paid. And even with the Dac and settings, they still weren't as punchy. The Solo3's...I don't know, everytime I listen to lossless, it feels like I'm in the studio with the band, but with the Studio Pros, it feels like I'm listening to an MP3 on an iPod from 2008. That you downloaded. From Limewire. I mean, again, it's FINE, they're FINE. But shouldn't we be expecting more than FINE? Maybe it's time to bite the bullet and just invest in a Pair of the Sony XM5's or, yes, the Sennheiser HD600's or 700's or 800's with a beefy Desktop DAC if I want to increase my experience.But these...these ain't it. (Side note: They're VERY comfortable, and if Comfort is what you're after, and only comfort, you'll love these.)","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AEMWNOMHJCIKJIJK354SLZ7QZISQ,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I tried them with my Android and though I can get Dolby Sound, the fullness just wasn't there, even with the phone's EQ. You can't use these on a device that has no sound settings, it will be horrible. That's the sacrifice when Apple took over. But on my iPhone, I set the EQ that Spotify has (if you know how to get to it), and wow! I was able to get all of the sound, including the bass I was looking for. Yes, Apple has taken away the muffled hard bass that Beats is known for and balanced it out. The EQ gives these a better and full sound. I use these with Transparency turned on and they sound just as good. ANC isn't the best but it does a decent job on the plane for me. Battery life? OMG! I only charge once every two weeks as I only use them for about 4 hours a day or so. Don't leave them charging, as with any battery, it will reduce the life of the battery. I am so happy I didn't give up on these. I traded in the black for the sandstone color and bought custom ear cushions for that original look. Upgraded from 1 star to 4 and not 5 only because of the first experience. Amazon customer service gets 5 stars! Money well spent.

R1525LERAB07PI,B0CMZD8688,4.0 out of 5 stars NO-ise cancellation,Bryce Underwood,4,"I have wanted a nice quality pair of over the ear headphones for quite some time now. During prime day, I saw these and decided it was worth a shot. The sound quality is really great, and the transparency mode is very clear. I am able to listen to music or my books while being able to have a conversation with family, and have complete awareness. They are quite comfortable and light as well, and I love the case! I have large ears, so they do ""stuff"" into these shallow cups. I have felt this with a lot of models I have tried on, so I wont give that against these. The only competitor that did great for size was the Apple Airpods Max, but I have not seen the best reviews on those for their price tag.But when using noise cancellation, I am very underwhelmed by it. During testing, I was on my back patio. I live on 1 acre lots, with the neighbors patio being a decent distance away. With no music on, i could hear them talking, as well as the quiet hum of the freeway that is over a mile away. I could hear my dog's nails on the concrete as they walked as well. I understand that not all ANC is meant to completely rid every noise, but I almost feel as if I should save the battery and use the mode as ""off"" with no ANC enabled. You hear more for sure, but in times I want that enabled I would rather hear next to nothing. This was with no hat or glasses on, with as much seal around my ear as possible.If ANC isn't your priority, the sound is amazing. I love the compatibility of it with my iPhone, and for the sale price I will be happy with these. I only hope as I travel on planes, the ANC will provide some help with the noise.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AHAOBBCAVRBLJFHZK5L2XDEDEBWQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R234Y6Y9SN7RW7,B0CMZD8688,4.0 out of 5 stars Honest Review,emmy,4,"I'll give it to you straight, as a broke college student i would NOT pay full price for these. I got them for 51% off which is a much more fair cost in my opinion.I've been wanting some good noise canceling headphones for some time now and I finally settled on spending a little more than I typically would on headphones on these.The headphones themself look very nice looks wise, I got the brown version and im very happy with the color. Id say they are a little tight on my head which gave me a little bit of a headache after short use but at least you know they wont slip.I got the app that comes with the headphones (see QR code in box) and I'd say getting the app is a MUST for full, easy function. On the app youre able to do things such as name your headphones, locate them (if lost), use noise canceling settings, etc.The noise canceling itself is the main reason I bought these. Id rate that feature a 2.5-3/5. When I turn on the feature in my app it blocked out the noise of my fan but not the TV or talking around me. It seems to only 100% block out smaller noises and quiet down the louder ones. The louder noice is significantly reduced but you can for sure still hear.In all, if you want to get these headphones, I would for sure say to wait for them to go on sale. I believe I got mine for ~180. Like I said I would NOT pay full price on these, save the money for a better usage.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2024",AGFN7BROHOLVJARFKJQUZOHLN7SA,True,0,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R3REKPIFS6TC75,B0CMZD8688,4.0 out of 5 stars Review And Comparison To The Sennheiser Momentum 4,vladislav grutsenko,4,"Highs: Beats > Sennheiser.High frequencies are good in both headphones, but Sennheiser has them more emphasized. Sometimes it feels like if you crank them slightly higher you're gona hear sibilants. It's on the edge and this is not the most pleasant edge to me. However, the sound is accurate and somewhat distinctive in the upper-frequency range for the Sennheiser. As for the Beats, highs are as detailed as on the Sennheiser (if not more) but not overemphasized.Mids: Beats > Sennheiser.Sennheisers have a so-called v-shaped sound profile so it feels like Beats have way more mids. It might be even too much at first, but you get used to it. Beats are more detailed and fast. Sennheiser feels muddy in comparison (but still very precise and detailed compared to Sony and Bose). I think it's partially because of overemphasized bass that brings distortion into the mid range. You start hearing things that were not originally intended to be there by artists. Because of this, Sennheiser sounds more ""musical"", it fills the voids between the instruments and produces an overall ""dense"" sound. And the Beats have more reference sound. For many instrumental tracks (rock, metal) Beats might sound boring and hollow. I can't blame the headphones because such music is usually mastered to sound good on consumer electronics. And you can't put good ""dense"" sound into an average stereo system. It will sound too muddy and.. just bad. So they leave the voids between the instruments and try to separate them. But on a reference headphone, this sounds... well... too reference :)Electronic music is a completely different story, this is where Beats shine! Electronic sounds are way more precise. And with Beats, you get this precision (especially in the complicated EDM tracks; I mostly listened to psytrance, psychill, idm, etc. But an average techno/trance sounds good as well). Sennheisers sound fine too, but only until you compare them with Beats.Bass: Sennheiser > Beats.The Beats are precise, again, and so is the bass. If the bass was intended in the music that you listen to - you will hear it. And you will hear exactly as much as it was planned by an artist. Rap songs sound great because of that, as well as some EDM tracks with massive sub-bass. As for the Sennheisers, well, they are v-shaped still so they add a subtle amount of bass to the overall mix, and in most cases, this sounds fine and even fun. It also comes without surprise that in bass-heavy rap songs, it starts to sound too overemphasized. In terms of precision, Sennheisers are not as precise but still hold their ground well against sony/bose/etc.Soundstage: Sennheiser > Beats.Soundstage feels subtly more open on the Sennheisers. Probably this is because they are not as precise and produce more ""parasite"" harmonics that make instruments sound further from your head. I like this effect but this makes me wonder if it's possible to achieve a good soundstage for closed headphones without compromising the sound speed and precision.ANC/Transparency: Beats > Sennheiser.Beats are slightly better in noise cancellation and noticeably better in transparency mode. Not as good as AirPods Max, but kinda close. Sennheiser is not bad though, it's just not as good. Wind can be a problem for both headphones, but I don't care. Beats are better at blocking fan noise but may overemphasize it in the transparency mode.Mic: Sennheiser >> Beats.Sennheiser microphones are superior both in terms of volume and quality. Beats is really mediocre, on the edge of what I would call ""usable"" for the zoom meetings. On top of that Beats mic sounds really quiet in Windows 11 rendering itself useless. I hope new firmware/drivers will fix that.Ergonomics: Sennheiser > Beats.I like Sennheiser more. Beats have smaller earcups with stiffer ear cushions. Also, the clamping force on my average-sized head is obnoxiously strong. Not to the point when I feel a headache after wearing them for a few hours but still too much in my opinion. However, I like the fact that Beats are more compact. It makes a difference when I listen to them in bed, for example. They don't rub as much against the pillow and don't produce a lot of noise like Sennheisers.Sennheiser ear cups are rotating 180 degrees when on the Beats, they barely move. This is important if you want to move one headphone back to open your ear when you need to listen to somebody or something from the outside world quickly. Or if you're a DJ and need to hear monitors with one of your ears :). Sennheiser earcups pivot and stay perfectly adjacent to your head, unlike the Beats.Connectivity: Beats > Sennheiser.Both headphones are ok when you're near the source, but the Beats stay connected longer as I walk away from it. The usable distance is like ~30% longer. They also perform better for a source behind a wire mesh or a security door. I know that Sennheiser is capable of working with 2 devices simultaneously and this works pretty well. Not sure about the Beats but I don't really care...Controls: Beats >> Sennheiser.Beats are very basic. They don't even have a head detection. And this feels soo good after the glitchy Sennheisers! You can read more details in other Sennheiser reviews, but they are really bad in that aspect. I bit the bullet and used them as my daily drivers, and oh boy... settings were getting changed randomly, I had tons of fantom head detection events, and when I wanted to put them on or off I almost always accidentally touched the right earcup sensor and triggered something (usually play/pause).","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2023",AHW6Y7QXQTDZZQHKFGWJCKTN66BA,True,277,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Use these normally when I go to the gym to tune out to any clinking weights and just so I can focus on my music or podcast. But the game changer is when I use these for daily chores while my kids are napping. I can still listen to music that I want, and listen to a podcast WHILE I am vacuuming and I don’t miss a thing.

But I enjoy there are different setting so I can hear all background noise if I need to. Sound quality is good for me. These are lacking on bass I enjoy some bass in my music so these really didn't meet that expectation. They are a bit tight like other people have said people with a larger head or ears might find them uncomfortable but I have smaller ears and head so it's good for me. The padding around the ear piece is very soft and comfortable. The padding on the head band is giving anti slip vibes but being anti slip it does pull hair a bit but it is soft and I don't feel like they are going to slide off my head if I'm moveing around. I haven't taken a phone call with them yet. Connecting to my android was extremely simple. Overall a good value for the price especially since I bought mine on sale but if you are looking for something that drowns out the entire world when you want a moment of peace maybe go with different headphones.

R3RSUGFYRCGKOF,B0CMZD8688,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound, Good Quality.",Spazzola,5,"Well, after having lost one of my AirPods (gen3) and not being able to justify purchasing a replacement left pod for $90, I started doing research.I came across these beats studio pros and looked at their stats. 40 hours of play time? Probably the most enticing thing about them to me. Then came the active noise cancellation, and spatialized audio. ANC intrigued me. I wanted it to be better than the AirPods at cutting out sound. While I was looking into these I happened to be doing it during Black Friday deals. Which meant I thought they were $170, which was the price of brand new AirPods. Then I saw their original price of $350. Which enticed me even more in a way, thinking of the price tag fallacy, higher price must mean quality. I mulled this over and over and eventually ended up missing the half off sale. Then I knew I wanted these babies. I watched and waited for a sale to come up again. I was not willing to pay $350 for wireless headphones, as I am not willing to pay $350 on just about anything, but thats just me. For me, $179 is splurging significantly. I caught another sale. I bought them and hoped for the best.I will have to be honest in saying I was hesitant to stray from AirPods and move over to headphones. The less I have on me the better, so having something sit in my ear rather than over my head appeals to me. But having my device constantly slip out of my ear or feel unsecured was not enjoyable. That’s how I lost my left AirPod in the first place. These headphones feel sturdy for me. I was pleasantly surprised. Although I still did not particularly care for a bulkier heavier device, I did appreciate their securedness. They do eventually make my ears sore but I usually just adjust them. I will not count this against them because every pair of headphones I have ever owned eventually made my ears hurt or gave me a headache. Im sensitive what can I say? The padding on the top band that goes over your head was a nice touch.The ANC is powerful. I loved being immersed in my music. I have no complaints really.Spatial Audio… I personally could care less about it, so I don’t have much to say about it. I just don’t use it as a personal choice, not saying it isn’t good.The sound quality seems adequate to me.The volume is pretty great, I never have to have it all the way up to get clear sounding audio or to feel like I can actually hear something. Which with my AirPods was a constant problem.The mic on these, I am thoroughly impressed with. Compared to my AirPods, its like award winning lol. People on calls usually can’t tell I am using a headset at all.I’m not sure how long it truly takes to charge them, as I haven’t charged them from dead to full yet. I imagine from the little bit of charging I did do when they first arrived they will take a little bit, but to me it’s worth it.Overall, I feel my money was well spent on a good product. I got a better bang for my buck with these beats than I did with my airpods. The compactness of AirPods are nice, and I like a compact item so having a larger device is something to get used to but I still think it’s worth it.","Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2024",AFGMDHUXSF76BWEEVF5IAL7E6NKQ,True,81,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

The cushioning is a very high grade plastic which is comfortable when the headphones are being worn for hours at a time and they are secure. I wear eyeglasses and I use these headphone when I am on my laptop watching a movie or videos on Youtube. The area where the eyeglass arm rests does not hurt but my ears will get warm and I take the headphones off for a few minutes to let the air circulate at the ears to cool down, this for my use is the only negative. Otherwise these are a nice upgrade to the $60.00 or less headphones. I was able to use bluetooth to connect to my Apple devices. However, I have encountered a snag to be able to connect to my Samsung tv that is connected to a wireless soundbar which I am still investigating. In the meantime I am enjoying and glad I purchased these Beats headphone and they were marked down making them a good deal. I would recommend and give as a gift.

RZGEO464CSXFR,B0CMZD8688,4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing product for the price,Eric,4,"After using the best studio pros for a while, I can definitely say that these are basically the Apple AirPod max’s but for a quarter of the price which is an amazing deal for the quality of headphones you are getting.Apple owns Beats and you get most of the features as if having AirPods and the accessibility of using them with iPhones . If you have an iPhone and pair it with the Beats Studio Pros, they will automatically pop up on your phone to connect like aipods do. Some of the same features include: being able to switch transparency/noise cancellation mode through your control center on your iPhone, Spatial Audio, Apple chip, ect. It is also lighter than Apple airpod max’s which is a huge plus for staying on your head. It includes an easy control system on the left ear on the headphones to allow you to play/pause, skip/go back, volume up/volume down, accept call/end call which is nice to be able to change the volume on the headphones which is something AirPods can’t do. They are very comfortable and sort of glue to your head and ears. You can adjust the headphones to fit to your liking as well. The color ways and the matte accent makes these headphones look slick to wear and overall they took out some small Beats decals on the previous headphones to make it look clean.Some flaws I have for the headphones are 1. That when you take them off your music will not automatically pause. This makes you take a small little step in either pausing the music on your phone, through the headphones, or continuing to play the music. I like how on the AirPods they automatically pause when you take an ear bud out so I wish these headphones did the same especially when Apple owns them. 2. They could be a tad louder. Don’t get me wrong, they are overall loud headphones but you have to get over half way in the volume to notice a loud change. Below halfway seems too quiet to me personally. 3. The case it comes in is slick, but the zipper design is annoying to get the headphones in and out of the case because the zipper hole is too small. Also the case is soft shelled and not hard so it’s not as protective as I want. 4. It’s a fingerprint magnetOverall if you are looking for high quality Bluetooth headphones, these are the best bang for your buck. Yes there are some flaws to this product, but the price is too hard to beat. These easily are the same audio quality as the airpod max if not better at quarter of the price. The design of the Beats Studio Pros have a better design than the max’s so I’d definitely suggest getting these if you want to save money.","Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2024",AGNFNGIJ4UL3ZZAKLWLBZ4BGPDMQ,True,8,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Additionally, there is no tone to indicate that I successfully turned on the headphones. I can’t always tell if they are on unless they pair to a device.

They're also pretty comfortable on my ears (they do fit good inside them though so they aren't squishing them- I'm not sure how comfortable they'd be if your ear doesn't fit inside them). They can get uncomfortable if wearing them with earrings but that's a given. All in all definitely worth the buy :))","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2024",AEEA6TD25YHCBKT4BJT3UJ4UFYRA,True,1,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R3PKX54VHP9QXO,B0CMZD8688,4.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones,margaret juarez,4,"I haven’t own a pair of headphones this is my first pair so my review may be biased on the quality of the headphones from sound to design but I have asked people around that have own many pairs of headphones for their opinion about this set and I will be incorporating their opinion on the sound.These headphones sound very good for its price, I was looking for something that wouldn’t break the bank (I’m a broke college student), have good sound quality, and noise cancellation. I wanted something to block out the little noises and hustle and bustle when I study in the library, in a coffee shop, at home, or outside. I read a lot of reviews from different sites and watched videos about the beast pro before I committed to them. What was important for me besides the sound quality was how good the noise canceling was. Many said that for the price it was a good head set for its quality, it was equal to the the quiet comfort 45 Bose headphones.Now the sound quality in my opinion is good, I will say though that for classical and R&B music it doesn’t give it justice. You can hear the music just fine but when you are in a noisy environment, even with noise cancellation, you have to put up the volume to hear lower and softer melodies. For more up beat music the music sounds better especially like pop, rap, country, etc. There isn’t a lot of base but you can control it’s sound, you just have to have the iPhone 11 or 12 and up to do that, I have an SE 2nd gen.The opinion that I have asked of others are an overall 7/10The battery life is amazing, it last for long periods of time, for 10 hrs of music straight the battery holds to a good percentage. If I hear for a few hrs of music a day for a week, I don’t have to charge it until the next week. And it charges so quickly too, it takes up to 30 min to charge full.I like how it have its own pouch to store it in with its adapters and charger, and have an extra zipper pocket to store in anything extra.Overall these a pretty good headphones if you don’t want to spend over $300 for a pair.","Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2024",AFJACG5ME2ZWJUUIUIXBOYBEYPKQ,True,6,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

RTHIK4B0U8KXP,B0CMZD8688,5.0 out of 5 stars Better than expected,hhoffa,5,"Everything about these are perfect so far. They cover the entirety of my ears so they don't press on the cartilage causing pain (especially since I wear glasses). They have 3 settings for sound, ""noise cancelling"", ""off"", and ""transparency"". The noise cancelling still lets sound in when nothing is playing from them, but when something is playing you can't really hear anything outside unless it's super noisy. Off makes it be just like a regular pair of headphones, and transparency is actually pretty amazing- put them on, nothing playing, and in this mode you can hear everything almost as perfectly as if you didn't have them on. When music is playing you can still hear some stuff from outside, but you still have to pause it to hear what someone is saying though.I bought an off brand pair of headphones for $25 in October and the pairing and ease of use was actually kind of complicated. BUT THESE. These are so simple, I love it. They also connected right away.My only gripe is maybe it could stay on the top of my head better, but I think that's because of how fine/thin my hair is and everything just falls off it. It's great that it's smooth, but because of it, even the gripper thing on the head part can't compete with my hair 😂(I own an android and forever will, these work great with them despite being an ""apple product"")","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2024",AHZFNBRVXADZFCDDK3RTOOR7TL2Q,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R1M1ZIK6WZ8AIK,B0CMZD8688,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Low cost AirPods Max alternative! A classic revisited!,Mahajo,5,"My earliest forays into a More expensive headphone was with the Beats Brand and the wired Beats Pro headphones. Then I graduated to the wireless Beats Studios, as well as the Executive headphones and those were my headphones for years. I don’t recall the noise cancelling being anything at all and of course there was no such thing as a transparency mode back then, but at the time I loved the look, the colors (especially metallic gold of the Beats Studios) and enjoyed the heavy bass sound they provided. As I grew more sophisticated and appreciated more sound quality, I moved on to other headphones (plus my last pair of Beats Studio the hinge broke on one side). I had tried the Beats Solo Pros and wanted to love them but they were, though improved, still an on-ear headphone and too uncomfortable for me. I had hoped then that an update for the Studios to Studio Pros was imminent but turned out it would be awhile before this did come to pass but I knew once it did I would have to buy them and try them out eventually. It didn’t take long as I saw they went on sale for $100 off only a month after release and I jumped on that deal! I am pleasantly impressed for the most part. They do a lot of the same things as the AirPods Max, if not as well. Sound quality is really good and has a more neutral sound than previous Beats Studios did. The Dolby Atmos with head tracking is fun. They are a little bright sounding and I sometimes have to either turn down the volume or use the eq on the iPhone Music App to lower the treble, or turn off the Spatial Stereo feature in the control center, (long press on the volume slider) but overall I find the sound pleasant and lively. There are no wear sensors, but I love the old school B buttons for pausing, volume and skipping and rewinding tracks very easy and intuitive after using Beats Studios for years so I don’t really miss it that much frankly. They are fairly comfortable, the cushioning on the ear pads and headband are plush but they do have a strong clamping force which might bother some but doesn’t bother me overly much, and I am fan of how stable they feel on my head. Noise canceling is quite good but as is expected not at AirPods Max level. I’ve always loved the 5 LED lights on the bottoms of the right ear cup which will show you the battery level when pressed. A double press of this button will switch between ANC and Transparency. Long press for Bluetooth pairing. No auto-switching between devices but once connected to a device in your iCloud, they automatically show up in other devices in the cloud and a press within the Bluetooth’s settings will switch it to the other device quickly and easily. The headphones will announce messages and you have the ability to use “Hey, Siri’ but I’ve noticed sometimes audio will stop with an announcement or Siri activation and may not continue playing music on its own, but a simple press of the “B” button will start play again. On the AirPods Max audio will reduce significantly but not stop, but with these the sound stops abruptly which can be jarring at first when the announcement is made. Of course you can turn off announcements in the control center if you want to avoid the interruption altogether. Build quality is plastic but still solid with metal sliders that have a jarring but somehow pleasing click as you slide them in or out. They are also very light, certainly lighter than the AirPods Max (which I also own). Also the case is nice with a spot for cables and even another pouch inside on the other side if you need it, but can’t really imagine adding much as with the headphones in, there really isn’t a lot of room. If you can get these on sale especially I would recommend then as a less pricey alternative to the more expensive headphones like the AirPods Max. I’m a fan of the sandstone color, I hear the dark colors, especially black, are finger smear magnets. These are a little bit like that, but with the light color it is much less of an issue. These are a classic revisited and I will always have a soft spot for the Beats Studio (now pros) headphones! I forgot to mention that you can use the usb c cable for lossless audio from your computer or iPad, which is awesome, although i have yet to try that out as I am all about wireless functionality, I don’t like being tied down to wires! Still great option, and one the AirPods Max cannot do (yet anyway). These are a great option for those not willing or able to spend more and still great a great headphone!","Reviewed in the United States September 11, 2023",AGUIQ5S5JSDEN4XKQGG5JPZZQNHQ,True,433,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R1MZVYL3ULXVYC,B0CMZD8688,"5.0 out of 5 stars The King is back, for a niche audience",Apple nerd,5,"I loved my Beats Solo headphones as a teenager. I’m talking monster cable beats. Nothing was cooler, the bass was thundering, and while it didn’t sound great, it sounded so much better than the iPod in ears or my dad’s old crappy walkman on-ears I was used to. I listen to mostly electronic music, bass/dubstep, house & techno, all of that with some hip/hop and pop sprinkled in as well. I also love movies.As an adult at home, I have my beyerdynamic dt 770 pros for mixing and editing with. I have a pair of AirPods Pro 2s for travel and day to day usage. Recently, I have started to work from home a lot more in meetings, and there has been a lot of construction outside my window, and I hate having things stuck in my ears for hours on end so I was in the market for a pair of noise canceling over ear headphones.My partner has a pair of AirPods Max, I found the sound to be really great, detailed with good sound stage and flat great for voice but clinical and safe in all respects and lacking the bass I was looking for. Even with the top-of-the-pack anc and apple integration features I was used to on my in-ears I never could swallow the price. Also they were comfortable, but so heavy and not suited for long periods of wear. And the case was weird.So I tried the bereydynamic lagoon ANCs. They were garbage. Impossible to use the controls and pair with devices, sounded really good but not as good as I would expect from this brand, and the issues go on and on. They did have good bass, but the anc barely worked. I liked them at a lot at first, but they fell apart so quickly.Then I saw that apple had brand new beats headphones, and were 30% off on Amazon. I had to try them, the nostalgia hit hard and I’m so happy they didn’t change the iconic design from the studio 2s which I also liked as a replacement for my solos. I. Am. Floored. Super lightweight yet feel very solid and no creaking, apple integration features (i consider no auto switching to be a plus tbh, but icloud pairing is a must. Works very well with Apple TV), but the sound! Is so FUN. It’s like I’m in a concert hall with huge racks of speakers and towers of subwoofers. So much better than my old beats, by a landslide. Great instrument separation, and decent soundstage, sounds less like a wall of sound like my pro 2s do but not as wide and spatial as the max. A little bright for my taste, but never enough to cause fatigue. None of them come close to the 770s of course - would I recommend these for classical? Or acoustic? Never. Or for any type actual professional work? No. But if you like electronic, you will have so much fun enjoying music with these. The ANC and transparency is very very good, identical to my AirPods Pro, I would argue maybe even better than the max in some situations. The mic quality is good, not as good as my AirPods but good enough for work calls. I also love watching movies, and having multi-channel support like my pro 2s is epic. I absolutely love these - and am so happy I got them!","Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2023",AEUHSKBV2ADJTTXVB55RN7UQQZTA,True,453,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R3GUSGB4IDV501,B0CMZD8688,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones!,celi,4,"Pros:- Lovely color (sandstone).- Fits comfortably over my ears (as I write this review, I've been wearing them for about 3 hours)- Nice, clear sound (I'm no sound expert, but for what I wanted them for, work + recreational, they've been great).- Head tracking/spatial audio is super cool!- AWESOME battery life. My headphones came out of the box with about 56% battery and though I just received them yesterday, after a good amount of use so far I haven't had to charge them yet, and probably won't have to for about a week.- Noise cancellation is excellent for my expectations/standards. I've read reviews saying they're not that great; I say if you're super-duper picky about this, and you're looking for absolutely NO outside sound at ALL, then yeah, maybe these aren't for you. I don't listen to music or audio very loud as I have sensitive hearing, so with noise cancellation active I can still hear small/faint muffled sounds in my surroundings (with audio paused/turned off): someone vacuuming, a thud from someone dropping something heavy upstairs, group laughter or yelling (if it's nearby). But overall, the ANC is certainly very good. With audio playing I really can't hear any of these things, except a faint hum of a very loud machine or my fiance, if he's next to me (he has a loud voice), but even then his voice is muffled and I can't make out every word unless he's yelling or shrieking.- Love transparency mode. Perfect blend of audio + surroundings.Cons:- While headband is cushioned and fairly comfortable for a short period of time, I do begin to feel a small ache at the top of my head after about 30 minutes of use. I have a small head, so I can adjust the headband slightly forward or back to remedy this, but I do find myself having to shift them every 20 to 30 minutes due to slight discomfort.- I'm not sure if this is something standard or not, but when plugged in to my computer with the basic audio cable, I cannot use the left ear controls to pause or adjust the audio volume; they only work in wireless/Bluetooth mode, or with the USB-C cable. The right ear transparency/noise cancellation mode button, however, does work regardless of how you're listening (wired or wireless).Overall I really like these headphones, and I'm happy I purchased them for the $169 sale price via Prime Day. I expect to get a lot of use out of them, and hope they'll last me several years as a reliable pair of quality headphones. I would recommend these if you're looking for good quality that may not be top dollar, but relatively close.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AFRRVTXY3LHOL5AJIPCUWW7QEJAQ,True,4,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R3H7Z64KP0058Z,B0CMZD8688,5.0 out of 5 stars Love them,Kage1218,5,"I was so happy to find these at such a deal (almost $200 off). I have really been wanting this type of head phone instead of my AirPods as, while I love them for separate reasons, they just don’t do music justice with how it play/relays to you and can’t ever get that volume to bump. I like the sound quality of the beats, the different settings, they are comfortable and don’t feel like you’re wearing earmuffs (my concern going from AirPods to these). The colors and finish are gorgeous and they are soft to the touch. Set up was the simplest tech product I have set up in a while. My only warning for those with longer hair, if you’re wearing them around your neck (to hear something, talk with someone, etc.) careful taking them off or putting them back on your ears, there is a small gap between the headphone part with the buttons (has the b on it) and it’s small enough to snag your hair and pull it out if you move quick without knowing. While this isn’t how they are shown to wear, it’s a comfortable way to wear while listening to. Just do so at your own risk of losing some strands of hair. I still give it 5/5 as I am more impressed with this than I expected and have been with quality sound in headphones in a while. Also, charge lasts good and it does not take long to fully charge either. The lights that show the battery level when you turn them on helps because if you see it’s at 3 when you turn on for an hour or so, you can charge when finished. I have yet to have the battery die on me and I’ve had them for a month now.","Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2024",AHC3ZOZMMPM4ILB57DTY3LWLUPUQ,True,11,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
RDHOFA7MKRYPL,B0CMZD8688,5.0 out of 5 stars THEY DESERVE NEGATIVE STARS,Warning Please Read!!!,5,"Please read this review if you are thinking of buying g these headphones!!!!! They are on sale for a reason, and it’s not because they are good or even meh. I compared them to my old Studio 2’s from 2013 (11 years old) and they are horribly different.I had high hopes for beats since I use the fit pros, and boy was I disappointed. More than disappointed I was let down. I still have my Beats Studio 2’s from 2013 the silver titanium color way, and I’ve loved every minute of having them because of the loudness and club-like thump they have to them. They are relatable to one of the cars that passes by you with the windows shaking because the bass is so hard. Especially after 11 years that they still work and function the same as they did when I bought them minus a few cosmetic defects. So with high hopes and promises that these Beats Studio Pros would be just as great, I ordered them and got the maroon color because I liked the color. I should have known that if the colors have to be nice to make up for how awful the headphones were I wouldn’t have even glanced at these.These headphones are great if you want to listen to something and you have a hearing aid so it doesn’t hurt your ears. The sound is not nearly as loud as the 2013 model and being 11 years old I was very surprised. Apple has ruined the name Beats and all of their headphones minus the earbuds since all earbuds are relatively the same(I have the fit pros now and they are great) but the fact that brand new headphones can’t outperform 11 year old ones is just sad. Disappointing. A let down. I was thinking the new model would be the same if not better than the old ones I have since the treble and mids may have changed in the time I’ve had the headphones but I was so wrong. They sound almost the exact same with one major difference. The bass. The one thing that I feel most people loved about Beats was the bass and how it would sound like you just walked into a club when you wear them. I was utterly distraught. The studio pros on Bluetooth were so bass negative I thought I didn’t have the volume all the way up. Once I realized I did I thought maybe it was just the fact I wasn’t using one of the ‘3 specialized audio modes’ that the new model has. Even there I was let down. I played different songs, tried different audio settings on my phone like bass boosted and acoustic and rock but none of them helped the headphones. So after all the thoughts that went flooding through my head, one thing stuck out. Apple had ruined the classic Beats headphones. Don’t get me wrong the sound of the treble and mids was fine but still nothing compared to an 11 year old model. I was highly disappointed overall and would not recommend these to anyone even if they have an unlimited budget. It is just not worth the letdown.","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2024",AFDOLKER2GHNCK53GDAR2YNQPMVQ,True,158,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R2FK6YBRHFTCMK,B0CMZD8688,"5.0 out of 5 stars Arguably as good or better than AirPods Pro Max for WAY less money, and USB-C",Tim Page,5,"These are not the overpriced, boomy, distorted Beats of the early 2000s. Ever since Apple acquired them, Beats has been making products that rival or surpass Apple's own at lower prices, and its like people haven't noticed. I have a pair of the AirPods Pro Max that my wife likes to borrow, as well as the older Beats Studio with the hated Micro USB port, which I actually find more comfortable to wear, especially if casually walking around or lying on the couch, but doesn't sound *quite* as good-- still respectable, but in a wired desk situation I still prefer my Sony MDR7506s on *well* mastered music (they're built for monitoring, so if a recording sounds bad, they're supposed to make you notice, ideally so you can fix it). So, when I saw this on a Prime Day sale I jumped at it. This pair of Beats uses USB-C to charge like every modern device *should* do, is just as lightweight and comfortable as the old ones, sounds noticeably better (I believe they upgraded the drivers and also learned some fancy new DSP tricks over the last few years), especially in the detail and control-- seriously, sound is subjective, but to me they sound at least 95% as good as the AirPods Pro Max and up there with a pair of Sennheiser HD650s I used to own that unfortunately got stolen (also, those were wired and open-backed, so not really a fair comparison, especially in the convenience and portability department). They also have all of the cool whiz-bang features of the more expensive AirPods (anc, transparency, surround, find my, easy pairing and switching). Unless and until Apple comes out with a new improved AirPod Pro Max equivalent that addresses the ergonomic shortcomings of the original (namely lightning charger, weight, balance, and clamping) I think these are the new king.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2024",AEAQHGLXYFP57C3J5S6ZIK42NNOQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2UXJLAZR33T40,B0CMZD8688,4.0 out of 5 stars Same Headphones for same price at Apple; Purchase AppleCare Plus for $29 from Apple,Amazon Customer,4,"I love my new Beats. I gave it four stars because I keep getting disconnected from my phone. I will update the rating if I figure out why and can correct the dropped calls. I will contact Apple support when I get a chance.This review is being written regarding AppleCare Plus. Huge suggestion: Buy AppleCare Plus directly from Apple for $29. Save yourself the hassle! Also, I recommend checking the price. I just purchase the Beats Studio Pro from Amazon for $179. Regular price was $349. Apple is also selling them for $179 as today, 6/16/24. I'm writing this long review I. Case it helps in regards to purchasing protection. I wanted to understand why AppleCare Plus was rate 4 stars instead of 5. I've had it and have it for several products and have always been highly satisfied. After reading nearly all of the 1-star reviews, the same message stood out- DO NOT PURCHASE APPLECARE PLUS FROM AMAZON. I decided to forgo reading the 5-star messages from approximately 64% of the customers, and just heed the message to purchase directly from Apple. Below is my experience in doing so. Again, to be fair, I cannot review the process for purchasing this plan through Amazon because I did not do so -I just wanted to avoid any hassle.I spoke with 3 different people from Apple's support team- one person via chat and two people on a phone call. All three people were extremely helpful, friendly, and made sure they did everything to help. It took nearly 45 minutes to purchase because the problem was my purchase date showed up as April 15, 2024 versus the true purchase date June 14th, 2024. The chat agency tried to change the date and it took down. Despite her efforts she was unable to change the date on her end so arrange to have someone call. A support person called, I missed the first call somehow,contacted the old chat message asking for a new call time. The support agent happened to called back anyways and the chat agent had also arranged a new call. So helpful on both ends. After speaking with the support person, he had to get additional help because again, the purchase date was not showing up. The last young lady I spoke to was able to work magic on her end and set it up where I was finally able to purchase AppleCare Plus for $29. I am highly satisfied with the support I received from Apple and I have peace of mind knowing my headphones are protected for 2 years! Next time, I will purchase products directly from Apple if the price is pretty much the same. This way, I can easily add AppleCare Plus! Had I checked before hand, I would have seen that Apple was offering the headphones for the exact same price as Amazon.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AEL3YFH2XJPGWP5J3F4I2KFB5KCA,True,2,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R17KWZY74P83HQ,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Very Solid For Out-of-Office,Jason Brannock,4,"I left a lengthy review of the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. Since that review is out there, I'll reduce this one only to E285 and SX4.Microphone and PlaybackThe E285 was notably better than the SX4, as evidenced by my recordings while drumming. It’s neck and neck as far as clarity of voice goes.Akin to the E285, the SX4 are quite good as far as pick-up goes. But unfortunately, they were a little too good (or simply worse at distinguishing background noise). A co-worker and I had a Zoom meeting with ourselves in the same closet (to maximize productivity), switching between the headsets. Whoever had the E285 could hear themselves through the headset. At first, I thought it was because of the function where you hear yourself through the headset. But alas, upon one of us leaving the room, the echo went away. This meant the SX4 was picking up the other’s voice! The main killer of the SX4 is that you have no way to mute yourself from the headset. As a pair of headphones to be used in the office, this is crucial. You never know when someone may decide to butt in your closet (or office, for most people) and shout “HHHHEEEYYYY!!”. In contrast, the E285 offers two ways to protect yourself from such intrusions – by raising the boom arm or by pressing the button on the boom arm, leaving you to look down simply in resignation at said co-worker without having disrupted the meeting. The one drawback with the E285 is that sometimes the first word or two don’t quite make it through, so you may develop a stutter of your introduction. “I’m Jason – oh – I’M JASON – oh you can hear me now? I’m Jason”. Good news is, you shan’t be soon forgotten. Despite this, it’s more favorable than not being able to mute myself, though I can understand disagreement with this point. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophileBoth associated apps come with decent equalizers (unlike Bose). Honestly, it was difficult to tell the difference between the E285 and SX4. I think the amount of bass you get is comparable, however I think the SX4 is capable of producing an ever-so-slightly louder sound. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.BrandJabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!Sony: same as Jabra, though with a caveat. The SX4 offers more utility when given Location permission, which will be addressed later on. They were not pertinent to me, however, so my location remains an enigma for Sony and Jabra (and Bose). Tie between E285 and SX4.ANCWhen playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. The E285 does a better job with impact noises (or maybe it’s just higher frequencies) than the other headsets, though the SX4 is perfectly satisfactory.In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. It almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). The SX4 has essentially the same feature, with an added “Focus on voice” option. I couldn’t tell a difference when that was on/off. Besides that, the SX4 didn’t do as good a job at allowing sound through as the E285. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.ConnectivityThe E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. Unfortunately, I don't remember specifics about the SX4. SX4 and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. The QC35II and SX4 are only Bluetooth, so you have to do the standard “add device”, etc. One annoying thing about the SX4 is you have to use the app to establish a Bluetooth connection to another device. Not a big deal, but for comparison’s sake, the E285 is better. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.Response time: The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Again, the E285 feel lack-luster in comparison because they take approximately 4 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-I seconds to pause, whereas the SX4 is half that time. For the E285, I’ve noticed the ear detection only works properly when playing music from your phone and not the PC. When using it with the PC, if I remove the headphones, the music will pause as it should. But it doesn’t resume when I put them back on. If I pause the music with the button, then remove the headset, it resumes. Again, cool feature, but needs work, especially when using it with the PC. So SX4 is better about ear detection (presumably because it's laser-assisted).App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.Voice AssistantThe E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature (you can still press the action button with the boom arm up and have the assistant prompt, but because the arm is up, the microphone is off so it’s pointless). Tie between E285 and SX4.ControlsOn the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. Muting is done with the E285 by simply raising or lowering the boom mic. In contrast, the SX4 doesn't have any way to mute yourself.After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.Comfort and StyleComfort is pretty much a tie between E285 and SX4. I've worn both for hours and hours without any issue. But I prefer the style of the SX4 - it just feels more premium. Winner is SX4. Runner up is E285.ExtraThe E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.IssuesThere’s some variability with functionality of the Google Assistant with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars, same as the SX4. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. I can't say the same for the SX4 since it was ultimately returned. I ended up choosing the E285 over the SX4 because it has an edge when it comes to office use, for one main reason - you can't mute yourself on the SX4. But if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.","Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2021",AGM4GFRMZNI3U2WHNRS734VKMZRA,True,67,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R709TK5SYB7PC,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Mostly great,Whirlaway,4,"UPDATE #2: After returning the first set of these headphones, I ordered another set on Prime Day and have now had a little more than a month to try them out. Based on this experience so far, I'm raising the rating from 2 to 4 stars. Trying not to jinx things, but the new unit does not have the right earcup static issue that plagued the first set (and that a not insignificant number of users have complained about). I'm not sure whether one of the firmware updates addressed the issue or whether the first set had a hardware issue of some sort, but the new set has not had the issue.I now believe the ""bluetooth stopping for no reason"" issue noted in my prior update is not a defect, but the speak to chat feature, which stops the playback whenever it detects a human voice. I understand the point of this feature, but Sony should calibrate it better. As it is, even when set on low sensitivity and not to focus on voice, it still stops playback at even low human voice volumes. As a practical matter, this means you can't sing or hum along to songs without having the playback constantly cut off. I've wound up disabling this feature.Other than that, the new headphones have been great -- super noise cancelling and music quality, decent phone call quality (maybe not best in class but more than serviceable), and day-in, day-out comfortable. The only reason I didn't rate them at 5 stars is that this set, like the previous one, has a very high default volume, such that sometimes when you turn the headphones on, the music will start blasting out at an uncomfortably high volume. (I think that if you use another set of headphones, as I sometimes do, the XM4 will forget its last volume setting.)UPDATED: I decided to mark these down from 3 to 2 stars because, in the last few days, the bluetooth has started to act buggy. Audio files simply stop playing for no apparent reason (in some cases, my music has stopped apparently because someone else with a bluetooth device gets within about 30 feet of me, but in other cases the music stops for no apparent reason at all). At other times, there are skips or pops. While the noise cancellation is fantastic, and I'm still thinking keeping them for this reason alone, I'm now more likely to return them -- $350 is just too much money for these kinds of problems.These are great headphones -- outstanding in many respects -- but they have some issues that, given the $350 price, do not merit a 5-star review. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on the lower rating given the very high price for this product.PROS:1) ANC -- by far, these have the most effective noise cancellation of any ANC (or other) headphones I have used, including Bose. They drown out almost all ambient noise -- including close lawn mowers, leaf blowers, revving car engines, etc. -- even when you're not playing music or listening to another kind of audio file. When playing music or an audio file, you are very much in your own world. I did have an issue at the beginning where I could hear a static-like sound when ANC was on but no audio was playing. A software or firmware update pretty much, but not entirely, eliminated the issue; it's still noticeable from time to time, but at a very low volume, lower than the older set of wired Bose ANC headphones I still have. It's no longer an issue for me; I think that this kind of noise is a ""feature"" of ANC headphones.2) Comfort -- by far, these are the most comfortable set of headphones I have used. The ear pieces in particular are outstanding. I bought another brand of (much less expensive) headphones right before I got these and wrote a review in which I said those were very comfortable. However, I wound up returning those because, after about a week, they became quite uncomfortable. These Sony headphones, however, have withstood the test of time, seeming to become more comfortable as time goes on. I can comfortably wear these for hours.3) Music quality -- excellent, what you would expect of Sony.4) Gesture controls -- the gesture controls for turning music on / off, picking up a phone call, volume and next / previous song work quite well. I had a set of Sony 900 headphones prior to these, and the gesture controls work a little better on these.CONS:1) Default volume -- for some reason, these headphones, like my prior Sony 900 headphones, seem to have a high default volume and there is no way in the Sony Headphones or Sony Music Center to change them (and there is also no native iPhone setting that works, either). The result is that, all too often, music comes blasting out at an uncomfortable, probably unhealthy volume when you put the headphones on and start playing music. Beside the Sony 900, none of the other (many) headphones I have used have had this issue. I have now become accustomed to checking the iPhone's bluetooth volume when I put the headphones on, but all too frequently when the iPhone shows a low bluetooth volume, the volume resets itself to a much higher (almost max) volume when I actually start playing an audio file. I believe the problem must be related to the fact that all the settings for these headphones are run through the Headphones app and there is no control for default volume in that app; apparently, Sony sets a near-max default volume and doesn't allow users to change it. It's really quite annoying, and I may wind up returning these headphones for this reason. For $350, Sony could do a lot better on this metric.2) Phone call quality -- meh. Some calls are good, others not so much. Nobody on the other end has complained about call quality. However, on my end, the other person often sounds distant, low volume, in a tunnel, etc. Every other set of wireless headphones I have used with phone call capability has been at least as good as these headphones, and some have been better. I read that the MX4 is supposed to have corrected the problems of the MX3 regarding phone call quality issues but, if that's the case, I can only imagine how bad the MX3s were.3) Making you register with Sony in order to get updates -- as noted above, I needed to do a software or firmware update to get rid of the static noise when ANC is turned on. However, to get software updates, Sony requires you to register with it (provide email, etc.). It is obnoxious of Sony to require users to provide this kind of personal information that it will then market and sell, and presumably also spam you with promotions, as a precondition to getting updates to fix the bugs in its (expensive) products -- particularly where Sony has a history of data breach.Bottom line, these are mostly excellent headphones, and they are exceptional with regard to the primary purposes of noise cancelling headphones. However, they do have some problems that a $350 set of headphones should not have. I'm likely to keep them, but if the default volume issue noted above does not improve, I may well return them.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2020",AGY3FKXCB7VCVYWXHL4MLDKIBUUQ,True,37,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R2USDO6PGSXOSG,B0863TXGM3,"2.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, good NC...multipoint Bluetooth FAIL!",John,2,"I've owned the Sony 1000XM3, H900N, and the Bose QC35 II. I couldn't wait for the XM4 to come out because of the multipoint Bluetooth (I'll get to that a little later). The sound is great once it's been adjusted, and the noise cancelling in the XM4 is better than both the XM3 and the QC35 II. However, there are quite a few things that are very poorly implemented and basically unusable.Sound: A-First off the XM4, XM3, and H900N all have better and brighter sound than the QC35 II. Out of the box, the sound is a little dull and the mids / vocals are a little mushy. With the XM4, I needed to tweak it in the Headphones app using the EQ to get it to the place that I wanted it, but once it was there, it was great. A small but pleasing improvement in the XM4 is that the headphone voice announcements are at a much higher quality. The XM3 announcements are low fidelity and low bandwidth whereas the XM4 headphone voice is very crisp and hi-fi. Sony also replaced the high-pitched beep with a slightly longer but more pleasant sounding bell for feedback. However, I actually prefer the beep because it's faster.Noise cancelling: A-When I first put on the XM4 and turned them on, I was surprised by the audible hiss from the noise cancelling. It wasn't present with the XM3. I think this is because they have cranked up the noise cancelling in the XM4. I have air purifiers running in my house, and the XM4 does a better job of cancelling out the noise almost completely. The XM3 still has some leakage. The XM3 is just as good as the Bose in noise cancellation, and the XM4, though a little hissy and is a slightly bit better. The drawback to this is that it can feel like it's creating a slight pressure in my head that increases over time.Multipoint Bluetooth: FThis was the feature I had been waiting for. The awesome noise cancellation and sound of the XM3, but with the ability to stream two devices at once. FAIL! I had been eagerly anticipating this and checking daily for the release of the XM4. I was so excited to get them...only to be sorely disappointed. Though the device will connect to two devices simultaneously, it actually DISCONNECTS when one of the two devices is activated. So it's not true multipoint Bluetooth. Sony advertises that the multipoint Bluetooth is seamless. This is true if they mean you don't have to press any buttons to disconnect from a device. However, the way it manages connections is very poor. I have to put the XM4 into pairing mode if I've connected to my phone in order for it to play audio from my computer. If I don't do this, it doesn't recognize that my computer is playing sound, and then doesn't stream the sound. Even though it shows on my computer as connected, it doesn't show up in my sound options as a device that I can use for audio. I have to turn them off, put them into pairing mode, and then reconnect in order to get the sound to play. If a call comes in on my phone, the headphones actually disconnect from the computer to switch to the call - and the headphone voice announces that they have disconnected, super annoying and not seamless. With the QC35 II, I could use both at the same time, with the phone being connected at the low-quality voice mode and my computer at the high quality music mode. They had 2 years to get the multipoint Bluetooth right and they totally failed. So it ends up that I have to turn the XM4 off and re-pair them just like I had to with the XM3. I've had to do this a number of times, and I haven't quite figured out all the exact situations where I have to re-pair them. With the XM3, I knew if I wanted to switch devices, I would have to do it. But with the XM4, I haven't put my finger on all of them just yet. At any rate, the switching of devices is very clunky and definitely not worth upgrading for. I have $40 headphones that implement multipoint Bluetooth better than the XM4. I'm stunned and disappointed that Sony hasn't been able to get multipoint Bluetooth to work right.Comfort: ACompared to the XM3, the XM4 are slightly softer and a bit more comfortable right when I put them on. The XM3 are still pretty comfortable, but the earpads are definitely firmer and a little tighter.Controls: BI totally prefer the actual buttons on the QC35 II to the touch controls. Sometimes if I want to change the volume and I slide my finger at a slightly off-angle, it will skip tracks instead. It's a small annoyance. On the plus side, the physical buttons do make a fairly audible click that travels through the headphone, whereas the touch controls are a little quieter.In-call: DOne thing the Bose QC35 II does is that when I'm on a call, it knows to automatically turn on ambient sound mode so I can hear myself talking. Neither the XM3 nor the XM4 figured out that this is a useful and great feature, so they don't do it. If I want it, I have to press the button to switch to it, listen to the announcement, and then it comes on. Then when I'm done, I have to press the button and wait for it to go into NC off, ambient sound off, and then press the button again and wait for the announcement that the NC is once again activated. Super slow and awkward and unusable. So instead, I pull one of the earcups off my ear so I can hear myself speak. When I first was using the Sony's for calls, I was finding that my voice was tired and my throat sore at the end of the day. Someone told me that I talked really loud when I was on the phone. I didn't even know this because the headphones do a really great job of keeping outside sound out, so I was talking at a level so I could hear myself when I was wearing them. I asked Sony support about this, and the headphones just don't do this. Fail.Auto-mute: FSony created a feature where the headphones will automatically mute the audio source if it detects that you're talking. Nice in concept - terrible in practice. I just turned it off and left it off. If I'm listening to music and sneeze or make a noise, the headphones will interrupt what I'm listening to and mute it for the amount of time I've specified in the app - 15 seconds is the shortest amount of time. So I have to wait for it to unmute so that I can continue listening. What's even more annoying is when I'm using the auxiliary cable in wired mode - again, this is because the multipoint Bluetooth implementation is such a pain and sucks, if I'm on a video conference and I have the headphones on to use the noise cancelling, if I talk, it mutes the audio stream for 15 seconds so I can't hear what anyone in the conference is saying. So I then have to turn the headphones off in order to interact with the conference in any meaningful way.Miscellaneous:I don't understand why Sony doesn't just include a headphone cable with a microphone. With all the video-conferencing I do, and the terrible multipoint Bluetooth implementation, I end up using the auxiliary headphone cable a lot. It's much faster and convenient for me to switch the plug from my computer to my phone rather than dealing with the horrible Bluetooth switching. The auxiliary cable Sony provides doesn't have a microphone, so I have to hold my phone close to my mouth if I'm using the cable. I ended up buying an auxiliary cable with a microphone and some playback controls on it and it works great. Here's another really poorly thought-out thing: upon pairing the new XM4 with the app, it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on the headphones. This is only upon the initial startup of the headphones. How on earth can I give meaningful feedback about the headphones on my first use? It took me to Sony's site to do the survey, and I decided I would complete it later, only to discover that it had timed out, and now I'm not able to provide feedback through that mechanism.Conclusion:All the hype about multipoint Bluetooth is a big letdown with the real product. If that's the reason you're thinking about upgrading, don't do it. The rest of it is pretty similar to the XM3. Some nice little features added, but nothing earth shattering. The new features on paper were everything that I wanted that was missing from the XM3. In practice, the XM4 implementation of these things just did not hit the mark. I soooo wanted to love these headphones, so that I could stop looking for headphones. As it stands, they totally weren't worth the upgrade and I will most likely be sending these back. Sadly, they are not as advertised.","Reviewed in the United States September 19, 2020",AFDEU4TPM7P7QRC7HKAXHD4O5L3Q,True,43,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
RJE80FBWZNCH6,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Mind blowing noise cancellation,Hugo Stiglitz,5,"The noise cancellation is insane. The first time i turned them on i couldnt believe it. I was used to pretty weak NC, and these are supposed to be the best. What a differenceOne thing i hadnt thought of is that noise cancellation actually does make a big difference to sound quality while previously i didnt think it was that important. But because it gives you an almost silent environment, everything sounds better.I also love that it has LDAC support. The transmission rate is automatic and unfortunately rarely uses the highest quality, but you can force it with developer options on any android phone (look up a guide to do that). The connection is perfect on the lower settings and you can go 100ft away from your phone and itll still work fine. Its only at the highest setting that theres any issues, but IMO its still worth using if you have high res audio files. Its near indistinguishable from the sound quality of a wired connection at the point (and assuming youre not in a totally silent envionment with NC off.TThe only weak point is the frequency response, but its also personal preference. Its balanced but bass heavy which a lot of people like. I don't. In my opinion it should be more neutral.When audio professionals mix and master music, they already put in as much bass as they can (in modern music) so there's no need for headphones to add even more. They know what theyre doing so it makes no sense to me to try and ""enhance"" what doesnt need to be ""enhanced""Unfortunately most consumers think more bass = better so headphone makers aren't afraid to add more than is necessary especially when other manufacturers add a ton, meaning if you don't as well people might say your product has weak bass, which isn't the case at all","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AF2WNSSZUVLPCMWGE7LNOXZTLGPQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

Do not walk down the street or drive with the noise cancelling on full. You will slip into your own world obvious of the surroundings.

This is a cool technological product. I have no issues with the stop-noise-cancelling-when talking feature.

R28ULTR4EVN00O,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, but be aware of quirks and limitations",tapu,4,"UPDATE 11/11/20: With the release of firmware 2.0.7 these have become usable for conference calls on Windows 10. The issue with initial syllables getting cut-off appears to be fixed and overall I have reports when using Skype and Zoom from my co-workers is that I now sound as good as (or maybe even a bit better than) other co-workers using Bose NC 700 headphones. According to Sony's release notes this firmware update is only supposed to address connection stability on Windows. I have increased my rating to 4 stars.UPDATE 10/30/20: No update from Sony on the microphone issue. My co-worker have asked that I use a different microphone as the microphone audio is quite poor. I'm outside the Amazon return window, but am currently working with Sony to hopefully get these at least exchanged if not returned.UPDATE: After a week, I am getting many complaints from people on the other end of my conference calls. Zoom / WebEx / etc. This is a serious issue that impacts me on a daily basis. I have put a case into Sony support and hoping they release a new firmware soon to fix the call quality.Below is my ""evergreen"" review which I will update whenever I have revised my opinion of these phones due to either new experiences or updated firmware, etc.Compared to my 2 year old Sony WH-H900N:Pros:+ More equalization options, including the ability to use the EQ with LDAC codec.+ Stronger ANC, particularly high-pitched whines and voices are significantly more attenuated by the XM4. Airplane or fan noise is not hugely different. Overall the ANC on the XM4 is superior.+ True multipoint connectivity allows you to connect the XM4 to two different devices simultaneously. Both AD2P and HSP profiles can be simultaneously connected to 2 different devices. The H900N can independently connect their AD2P and HSP profiles to two different devices which can allow music to be played on a PC while using a phone for voice calls, but it is tricky to connect/disconnect the correct profiles each time you power cycle the headphones. The XM4 are much improved on this front, although the priority switching is a bit dodgy in my opinion and takes a few seconds to detect and switch devices, so it's easy to miss notifications or other brief sounds when multiply connected.+ The XM4 are better for making calls in noisy environments, although the overall quality is mediocre at best. Any halfway decent gaming headset or office headset will do a better job of capturing just your voice. I tested versus my Sennheiser G4ME One wired headset.+ (slightly) more compact travel case since the earcups both swivel and fold whereas the H900N only fold+ XM4 allows you to mix in a variable amount of ambient sound whereas the H900N has only 1 setting for ambient sound+ The WH-1000XM4 while improved, are still poor in windy situations, even when put into ""wind"" mode, which does help. I haven't had a chance to compare the XM4 on a voice call in windy environments. The H900N are unusable in wind for phone calls, I have to switch to the handset.Cons:- The WH-1000XM4 have significantly less Bluetooth 4.0 range, I get crackling and break-up within 3 meters where the WH-H900N easily reach 10 meters. This is a big deal when working from home. With the H900N I could make a phone call from the kitchen with my computer in the office and be pretty confident that I could still speak and hear everything. With the XM4 I can't leave my office without huge glitching. EDIT: I swapped out my BT4.0 adapter to a BT5.0 adapter on my desktop and with this, I can get ~20 meter range with my XM4, still not quite as good as the H900N gets with BT4, but acceptable for my uses.- Overall, WH-1000XM4 do not sound much better, in fact at default factory settings, the midrange is a bit muffled and bass response bloated versus older headphones, tweaking Clear Bass setting to -2 helps- The WH-1000XM4 ANC presents a low-level background hiss and a sucking sensation on the ears- The WH-1000XM4 do not support Qualcomm aptx codecs- The WH-1000XM4 have worse microphone quality when used in quiet environments.- Hold-hand-to-right-earcup-to-speak actually works better on the older headphones as Sony apparently wants you to use the deeply problematic speak-to-chat automatic feature insteadEqual:* Battery life is roughly the same, with ~24 hours for the older headphones versus ~30 hours for the newer* Bluetooth pairing is similarly slow on both headphones* Both support LDAC codec for high bitrate sound (although when in 2-device mode LDAC cannot be used)* Overall weight and comfort is similar, with the XM4 being a bit lighter* Ear heat is a problem with both headphones, slightly cooler on the XM4* Neither headphone can use the microphone when listening via wired connection, come on Sony!* Neither headphone can be used as a USB headset (even though the phones are recognized by Windows 10, they do not show up as an audio device)* Touch controls are essentially identical, in fact the H900N are actually a bit more responsive although perhaps I'll get used to the XM4Personal Preference:* The style of the older headphones is a bit nicer in my opinion, and they are available in more colors* The newer XM4 use USB-C charging versus micro-usb for the older headphones. This should be a pro for the XM4 but the XM4 won't charge on any of my USB-C PD chargers, so I have to either plug them into a port on my computer or find an old low-power phone charger to charge them. The H900N are less finicky about what charger they will accept.* The ""silver"" XM4 is really a grayish-beige which is pretty ugly, I wish I'd have bought boring basic black.Overall I am disappointed that these are not a bigger upgrade over my 3 year old headphones. I knew from various reviews that the H900N sounded better than the 1000XM, and 1000XM2, with reviews being a bit equivocal on the XM3. I was expecting the XM4 to blow the H900N away, but really they are barely better except for multipoint and ANC.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2020",AGNOHQRHY74UUQ6YUYPHD5MWD6JA,True,17,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
R1KYYRPR3VE2DG,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Get these...at the right price,H. Ricks,4,"I got these as a 2023 Christmas upgrade from the XB-900. I loved their sound quality (especially the bass of the XB-900), but it lacked conveniences that made it difficult to use those on a regular basis (being that I'm in the Apple ecosystem (iPhone/iPad/Mac and Apple TV). When they were around 30% off, it was a no-brainer.The ANC is still great. They may not be on the level of AirPods Max, but they're just as good as the XM-500's. The sound quality is more 'balanced,' so while you don't get massive bass (like the XB series, Skullcrusher or Sony Ult), they can keep up.But my favorite aspects, coming from the XB900's, are its ability to multi-pair between 2 devices. It was frustrating to have to go through a process just to switch devices. Granted, you have to use the app to enable them between devices, but that's still better than having to go into bluetooth settings and unpair, then re-pair.Also, I like the play/pause gesture feature that weren't on the XB900. While it wasn't that much of a biggie (be it tap the cup to pause or pause on the app or device), it felt more natural to just take them off for it to pause your media. And, unlike some of Apple's offerings, I like that you can create your own EQ settings than their stock settings.While it took some time to modify the settings for ANC/pass-through (based on work/home/travel environments), the experience when using is great.Overall...the XM-400's are as good as the newer 'flagship' XM500 (almost forgot: they fold better...be around your neck or case). You're getting great sound, great ANC, great battery life, decent build (albeit plastic) and great customization. But if you get these when on sale (especially around or under $230), you're getting a premium device at a 'Goldilocks' price!My 3 cents...","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AH34Y7RKTMJ47UGXWZPX25J3JMZQ,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

Battery life is respectable, lasting a full day easily, and charge very quickly in about an hour.Only 'issue' is that they press on my ears pretty good, so I can't use them for more than, say, 3 hours before they become a bit uncomfortable and I need to give my ears a break. The other is I live in hot Puerto Rico and I can sweat a bit because of these. Wouldn't recommend them for working out, like I see others use at the gym; use any type of buds for working out instead. But these issues are inherent to over-ear headphones, so I can't take points away. Full 5 stars, the best by far, if you will be in a nice cool environment and won't be doing anything too active.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2024",AFKMNBTT5XRE2L2AYHZZFVASEZ7A,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

R2PLH336KUYCO9,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Sounding but Relatively Dumb,Jason H,4,"These headphones sound great. I have been testing them against AirPods Max with my iPhone.Used, they are an exceptional value for this quality of sound. However after wearing them many hours I have decided to go with the AirPods Max as my primary pair, because they are extremely intuitive and the transparency mode is great for my house with noisy young children I still need to communicate with.The XM4’s attempts at being smart kust annoy me, like automatically turning off when I sneeze or sniff with a cold. The transparency mode amplifies annoying sounds like silverware falling in the sink. You can disable all of that, and are left with a great sounding headphone for the price.If it is within your budget the AirPods max will serve you far better if you, like me, like to wear headphones at all times. The only potential drawback of the APM other than the price is the weight, but I found them fine.I may keep these for travel, as they are light, the noise cancellation is excellent, and I wouldn’t be devastated if they were lost or stolen.Around the house I will use the Apple headphones. The usability of these two is not even close if you use an Iphone. The Apple APM are so inituitive you only have to remember to charge them.

R38T61DMMWO74Q,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Sony WH-1000XM4 vs. Bose 700 vs. Jabra Evolve2 65, mostly for Zoom meetings",Michael23,4,"I was looking for headphones for work and personal usage. I did a lot of research and it was clear that there was no one model that was best at everything. So, I prioritized what I was looking for (in rough order):1) physical comfort (nothing else really matters if they're painful to wear)2) blocking out outside noise (household noise, cars passing by, leaf blowers, etc.)3) technical ease (i.e., easily connecting to both my phone and laptop)4) microphone quality (for phone calls and Zoom)5) sound quality for music (I tested with EDM and IDM music)6) cost (I was willing to pay more for quality as long as it wasn't outrageous)7) battery life (not really important to me as long as it gets through the workday)After a lot of reading, I narrowed it down to five:Bose 700Sony WH-1000XM4Jabra Evolve2 65Jabra 85HJabra Evolve 75And I ultimately ordered the top 3.Here's my review:Sony WH-1000XM4:- This was the clear winner for me: most comfortable, best at blocking out outside noise, excellent music quality, and easy to use- I appreciate how it automatically adjusts the noise canceling settings based on activity (sitting still, walking, etc.), and I had no trouble connecting it to my phone and computer at the same time- The biggest downside (other than the high price) is that it was definitely the worst microphone of the three. People on the other end were able to understand me, but when I listened to recordings it definitely sounded more muffled and less clear than with the other two headphonesthough its microphone quality isn't great- It's probably also worth mentioning that my brother tried these on and he found them uncomfortable because he has large ears, whereas the Bose 700 felt fine for himBose 700:- This was a close runner-up: good at blocking outside noise, comfortable enough (but I felt it squeezing my head more than the Sony), and good music quality (I even preferred it to the Sony for some songs, though in general I felt like the instruments were somehow a bit further away or flat compared to the Sony)- It gave me just a little trouble to connect to phone and computer at once but it was fine once I got it set up the first time- The microphone was noticeably better than the Sony's but still not greatJabra Evolve2 65:- Surprisingly good music quality given its purpose as more of an office headset; but, given its protruding microphone arm, I was expecting significantly better mic quality than the other two when in fact I only found it to be a little better than the Bose- Fairly comfortable, but I preferred the way that the other two completely enclosed my ears rather than just squeezing against them as the Jabra did- Setup was easy and I appreciated the USB dongle to wirelessly connect it without fiddling with BluetoothSOME TAKEAWAYS:- Ultimately, I learned that all of these have pretty bad microphones, so you'll need to get a dedicated microphone if you really care about recording sound quality- This is of course personal preference, but I still find my Jabra Elite Sport earbuds from 2018 to be more comfortable than all of these, and they surprisingly had just as good or better microphone quality than all of these fancier larger headphones. I'm able to wear the Sony or the Bose headphones for a few hours, but my ears still feel a bit tender when I take them off- I was quite surprised that the active noise canceling was fine for me on both the Bose and the Sony. I had tried a previous Bose model years ago and experienced a lot of painful pressure on my ears, so I was quite happy to discover that I rarely experienced that here. I'm not sure if the tech has just gotten better or if I've acclimated somehow, but consider giving the Bose or Sony a try even if you've had trouble with this in the pastDECISION:I ended up choosing the Sony WH-1000XM4, which are in most ways the best headphones I've ever used (with important caveats below). When I started my search, my top priority was how well they worked for Zoom calls. Music quality was a secondary concern. But after spending weeks with these headphones, I'm pretty blown away by how my music sounds, like new dimensions have been opened up. I recommend them, along with the Wavelet smartphone app for AutoEq equalization tuned to these headphones specifically. However, there are two glaring flaws you should know about:1) The microphone quality really isn't great. When I'm in Zoom meetings, I set it to use my laptop's built-in microphone instead since it sounds better.2) It does pair well with my laptop and smartphone at once. But, there are some quirks that are extremely annoying. Whenever one of the two disconnects, a voice loudly announces, ""Bluetooth device disconnected."" So, say I'm listening to music on my phone or on a phone call—if my laptop falls asleep or I turn it off, my music or call will be interrupted with that useless announcement. Even worse, whenever you answer a phone call, it disconnects momentarily from the computer, so as soon as your phone call begins it makes that loud announcement and you miss the first few seconds of your call.Yes, you heard that right: If your laptop is on and the headphones are connected to it and your smartphone (which is supposed to be one of the best features), then every time you answer the phone the first few seconds of the call will be interrupted.So that's why it loses one star. But truly, the music quality and noise-canceling are so great that I really like them anyway and am willing to work around this limitation. I sure wish Sony would release a firmware update though allowing us to disable that voice completely!","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2021",AHYELS2PGI2XCI3HB3O5UDG3JQUQ,True,57,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

It took some experimenting and help from reddit to get them back to default. Over time the ambient (pass through) mode develops a noise like wind or passing traffic making it difficult to listen to anything in that mode. They are comfortable but not for wearing more than a few hours. Im hoping the hinges don't suddenly snap like my 720 did (lasted a couple years).

RJH9CGWFW4229,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Love them,Mya,5,"I was initially considering buying the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones, but after seeing so many negative reviews I went with these (and i’m so glad I did). Both the noise canceling and transparency on these is fantastic and they hold a charge for a long time. The sound is clear and crisp, and can be adjusted to your tastes in the app. I bought mine used and they still work great. The only downside would be is that they do leak sound a little bit, but it’s only really noticeable in a dead silent room or if someone is sitting right next to you. Overall, 10/10 would recommend!","Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2024",AHNZY7EHKCL6LJ7TERORGDAVPF6A,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R32NKDVGVF2QPR,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works great!,JWH,5,"The Sony WH-1000XM4 Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works great! Put on the headphones, turn on the power and it's like the aircraft engines have turned off - the low rumble is just gone. Entertainment doesn't have to be turned as loud in order to hear it clearly.The best thing about the Sony is that it can be used ""wired"" into airline entertainment, rather than having always to rely on finicky BlueTooth. The Sony comes with a two-prong adapter to fit the airlines two-prong plug holes, but the adapter isn't necessary (at least on United Airliness 787 aircraft). It appeared to me the two-prong aircraft sockets were made up of 3.5mm and a 2.5mm holes. (I didn't have a 2.5mm plug, so I can't swear to that.) The Sony jack was 3.5mm and it worked well plugging it into the other, 3.5mm, socket - complete stereo worked. From testing at home I'd say the wired configuration provides slightly better sound than through BlueTooth, also. Wired appears to provide better power usage, too; I used it on a 17-hour flight for three movies, I think, and arrived with the power level at 80% from starting at 90%.It does require a bit of a learning curve, so I wouldn't expect a newbie like me to pull it out of the box for the first time while on the aircraft and expect it to be satisfying. This is my first ANC device in maybe 10 years and that first experience wasn't successful, so it took me awhile to try again. Basically, hold the power button for two seconds to turn it on, hold it for seven seconds to pair with BlueTooth. You can get by without the Sony headphones app, but without it you won't know the battery charge level or be able to change sound profiles; I want to hear dialog better, so I have bass present, but not overwhelmingly so. Interestingly, you can pair the headphones with two devices at the same time, while other ANC earbuds just switch fast between two different connections. Both appear to work okay and allow you to listen to your cellphone music or the aircraft entertainment. Sony has short little movies that walked me through headphone settings.That's a lot of ""pro,"" but there are a few ""cons."" Over-ear headsets are bulky and have to be carried in already stuffed carry-on luggage. Some people don't like the pressure of over-ear headsets on their ears. That's about it, though, and if you've bought them at all then these issues don't sneak up on you. I've had them for a month or so now so I can't speak to their sturdiness or long-term reliability, but they do appear to be sturdy and the case protects them.What would I like to see improved? Not much, for over-ear ANC headsets. If I could find a set of wired ANC earbuds I'd surely try them to cut down on the bulk, but they'd have to work very well to provide the same sense of isolation I get from over-ear headsets. As things are, this Sony is definitely a ""buy.""","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023",AEGS73DFBTN563YPSMA2EM2EEEAA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

They look almost identical to the earlier 1003 version but the sound is definitely upgraded. Much more bass-capable with the 1004’s. Using the Sony app and adjusting the equalizer brings them alive. The noise canceling is top notch, as good as any Bose but the Sonys are light years ahead of Bose when it comes to music. Musically they’re as good as my Bowers and Wilkins headphones.

I use a nice pair of monitoring headphones for my music, a gorgeous pair of consumer headphones for relaxation listening, and I've owned many pairs of in-ear and over-the ear headphones through the years. I've now had these Sony WH-1000XM4s for two years, and I think they're all-around the best best headphones I've ever owned. If I could only own one pair of headphones for the rest of my life, I'd pick these. They're my desert island headphones, if the island had somewhere I could charge them.They're not the best at everything - I need my ATH-50s for a studio flat-response, thinksound ov21s for pleasure listening, vmoda m100s for electronica, another brand of in-ears for working out. But the Sony XM4s produce very high quality sound, and are insanely comfortable. They're my go-to work and travel headphones, and I can wear them for hours and forget they're on my head. The noise cancellation is also excellent. They're easy to fold up and take with me (always in the case)If you're looking for a high-quality all-around pair to wear while you work or travel, this is it.

The pleather ear cushions are very soft and comfortable and create a good noise cancelling seal, but offer no cooling and make my ears sweat. I have a big head so I had to stretch the headband out a bit. I also purchased the replacement MESH ear cushions. Noise canceling has deminished but my ears don't sweat anymore; its a trade-off. Mine came with a carrying case with all the cables needed. The charging cable was a mere, 12inches; maybe shorter. The carrying case is upside-down. The external ""pocket"" is on the underside because when you put the case down correctly so the headphones don't plop out, that mesh pocket is on the underside.

R3LOW0OAVZVPNN,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise canceling, everything else is ok",MyHonest2Cents,4,"In passive mode, the sound quality is all over the place, resulting in some of the worst headphones I've ever used in this price bracket. In active mode, it's... decent, with boomy, mildly unclean bass; acceptable mids; and messy but listenable highs. It is very responsive to EQ past sub-bass range, though you can crank up the already boomy mid-bass if that's your thing and it can get pretty loud. At about 70–80% volume, the amp begins to distort, and at 100% volume the distortion is highly audible and really crunches the highs and muddies the bass. There is also a noticeable frequency response and volume difference between the cups, likely due to the indentation for the sensor array inside the left cup; if you aren't listening for it, it is still noticeable sometimes, but it fades to the background if you are using the noise canceling or are otherwise occupied.The ambient sound feature does not pick up outside sounds very clearly. If you're using the Sony | Headphones Connect app, you can enable a ""voice mode"" for ambient sound that cuts out the bass and boosts vocal range with EQ, but it cannot be turned on with the toggle buttons on the headphones themselves or when connected to PC, making it tedious to enable without the automatic switching feature that tracks your location and habits to enable it when it thinks you need it. The noise canceling however is truly top of its class and easily removes 80–90% of outside noise, and you can't hear anything else if you're playing something. I have noticed that the DSP appears to crank up the bass, either to compensate for the harder-to-remove low-end frequencies or to trick you into thinking the noise canceling is better than it really is in that range.The ear cup touch controls work fine and I have not had any mis-inputs, though volume up/down steps are too small. You can hold down the up/down slider instead of repeatedly sliding your finger, but the repeat delay is very long and it takes forever to adjust to what you want.The headphones are fairly adjustable to different head shapes, but if you have a reeeally big head/ears or lots of hair it may be difficult. The headband padding is a bit hard but the headphones are so light you can't feel it. The closed cups have no ventilation so your ears stay warm, and I imagine it would get sweaty in warmer weather.The headphones can fold flat and can sit around your neck comfortably. The auto-pause when it detects you remove them, and the 15 minute auto-off means you don't ever need to bother turning them off explicitly, just take them off your head and put them down. Their ability to fold also works great for stowing them, and you can fit them into any bag. The included carry case is a bit bulkier than it probably needs to be, but it's still small enough to fit in even a medium sized purse, and it does have room for cables and small accessories.The mic quality is pretty bad and doesn't pick up your voice well. What it does pick up well is everything around you. You'd think Sony's engineers could have used the ambient sound mics to dampen outside noise while focusing on your voice, but it unfortunately doesn't do that. Call sound quality in general takes a major dive due to the protocol it uses under the hood; it halves the sample rate and sounds like a cheap dollar store headset.The battery is massive; I charged it to 90% once I received it a few days ago and have not had to charge it since with daily listening. Rtings.com got 37 hours out of one charge, far past the advertised duration.Overall all of the features work to an acceptable level, except passive mode sound quality. If you are buying these for the battery longevity, small stowable size, ease of use, and noise isolation and canceling, they're a great package. Great for traveling. Would not recommend for even casual listening, get a good closed back pair like the Hifiman HE-R9 + Bluemini R2R wireless dongle. If you need to make important calls or want headphones for conference calls or online meetings, these will work, but it won't be pleasant—get a dedicated conference headset.If you really insist on these for more active listening situations, do yourself a favor and get the AutoEQ preset for them as a baseline, and tweak to your ears. I also recommend a -1dB loss on the left earcup to help offset the response difference, though it's an approximation and not perfect and differences in track volume will make this obvious. With these changes, passive mode is at least bearable.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2022",AGXVB4UEYOJCFXO6XR45I52IWWWQ,True,8,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

For example, if you have a hoodie on, jacket with hood, etc... touch control is sensitive and fabric, cord, ect... will effect the touch controls.- I am running iphone X with latest iOS, should be receiving iphone 12 Pro this eve and will update with any new comments.UPDATE April 2020: been using these headphones for several months now. Running and walking are great however, the Touch Sensor Control is not ideal for me, especially when using while exercising.

R1JKUN1J8FVF5H,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beast Headphones, solid Noise-cancelling/ beautiful sound/ Comfort.. But don't pay full price.",xnpate,4,"Last several months I've spent studying for MCAT, and as it neared the exam I needed more time away from distractions and due to the pandemic sneaking away to my local libraries wasn't an option as I could only be there for an hour or two tops, I needed NC headphones being at home. Typically anytime I saw anything NC the WH1000 series was the way to go, as advised by the tech world and audiophiles. I had found a good deal on Airpods Pro and during Prime Day Deals found these. I was shocked to find the latest Sony headphones discounted $50 and bundled with $25 Amazon GC as well. The reason I mention Airpods is because I personally have seen many comparisons. I'll break down as much as I can below, I don't consider myself an audiophile.Pros:When it comes to sound and listening to music with the Sonys hands-down best thing I've listened to and gives like new life to music. These are built really nicely and cushioned really well up top and around the ears. Oh man boy are they lightweight!. Some heat around my ears after using them for a bit, and they press on my glasses (but they're crappy glasses that I have problems with beforehand anyway) so they press in my ears/head.Battery: Lasts me several uses on one charge, meaning I can use them a good 4-5 days before wanting to charge them. Sometimes I can get a couple hours in and still not even lose 10% of battery life. (when compared to Airpods, no question Sonys better). When not used for a period of time they will automatically shut off so even better.Case: Nice holds your cords and headphones nicely. It's not a hard case though so I'd be careful shoving them into tight spaces against things.While i mentioned the cables... Sony needs to make the charging cable longer it's INCREDIBLY short.Cons:Touch controls: The lack of buttons to control Play/Pause, Volume, kind of sucks for me. At first it seems fun and intriguing. But over the course of using them, I find myself swiping and hearing the feedback that something is being activated but actually wont happen. There are moments when I'm stretching or resting my behind my head and arm knicks the touch control and pauses the music. And this is weird because the touchpad can be really sensitive like in that example, but other times wont register I'm trying to activate the controls. Volume should absolutely just be a wheel, pause/play skip features as touch I'd be okay with.Dual connection: I haven't had much use of this, at first I had my laptop and iPhone connected. Now Idk if my problem is due to my older computer with older Bluetooth, but my sound went silent on my headphones. I haven't connected them back to my laptop since. But I think ideally this would be great to be connected to your phone/computer and get notifications. There is a delay between activating playback from one device to the next.Mic: Friends have told me my voice sounds artificial with Sonys and prefer if I wear my Airpods to communicate if I want to use headphones.Noise-CancellingTo anyone who wants a comparison between Airpods Pro and these. If I hadn't had Airpods Pro right before purchasing these I'd have nothing poor to say about the Sony's NC. Airpods as they go in the ear already help with dulling sound before activating NC. The biggest issue I have in my house is the droning of my AC and Fans. Airpods make them disappear and sound like a light breeze or wind without all the mechanical droning from noise machinery. Sonys do a good job for those sounds for me, but not as well as the Airpods. HOWEVER, this is before any music or sound playing. Once you have something playing with the Sonys the world is gone and that's about half-ish volume. I find myself speaking louder at times not even being able to realize my brother is talking right next to me. I don't necessarily have the same effect with Airpods. And you don't have to worry about fit.ConnectivityI've heard that with Android getting the XM4 connected is quick, but even with iPhone it's simply connecting another Bluetooth device. (compared to airpods obviously the apple interface is as simple as opening your headphone case)AppPretty easy to follow interface, readily updates. If you like experimenting with equalizer settings then you'll have fun. I've heard people complain it being complicated, but without messing with anything except turning off a setting that pauses audio when talking. You can leave everything as is and really not need it after the initial setup and for updates.Final thoughts if you have the money I'd go for these they're wonderful, but I don't think these warrant the full price TBH. The touch controls can be finicky, but if you want quality sound/NC/Comfort/Fit this is it. Anyone seeing this right during the holidays with BlackFriday/Christmas/Cyberdeals whatever; I was shocked seeing these brand new Sonys discounted to the same price as the XM3 on Amazon, I'd look for these and nab them when discounted.","Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2020",AFY3JHUWWTAHBJZNBVXSOOORVGMQ,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

R2D8OVJ75Z7DSP,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars 1000 hr review,C Stribs,5,"Alright, So I have put alot of time into these 1000xm4s over the last three months. These headphones are fantastic! However it took me about 50-100 hours to get used to them. I'll explain. So I have owned cheap ""noise canceling"" TAO Tonic $40 black friday special wireless headphones and I had good wired $200 Sennheiser 599 open ear headphones. My previous experiences with headphones were to get the most out of the audio or to cancel out noise I needed to near max out sound volume and reach deafening thresholds. After listening to these headphones I started to realize I needed to change the way I was using them. First of all the app is nice. You can adjust the EQ to custom or use a preset EQ setting. I chose to turn off the speak-to-chat feature as it would easily pick up my voice if I was singing along or even if i made any loud audible sound while moving around or working out. Anyways, getting back on track I found that I could listen to music, podcasts, Netflix, ect. at a very low level and hear everything perfectly. I have been so use to staying up at a 80-90% volume level from my previous headphones that I was alittle sad that the 80-90% level on this headset didn't sound as loud as my older headphones. Simply put these bad boys do such a great job at noise canceling that you can clearly hear audio at very low levels. You may not feel a lot of punchy bass with them (it's there though) howevere, you also won't hear any sound distortion when bumped up to max levels. Also, these Sonys will automatically and continuously track your environment and adjust noise canceling or ambient sounds accordingly; like if you're laying in bed or get up to a walk around, or sitting is a white noise environment like a plane. Its pretty awesome and will probably protect your hearing, but sadly it will not save your bank account. If you plan on using these for working out they will be a solid option. Again, I haven't heard any distortion while working out on a treadmill, bike, or rowing machine. Since they are closed ear/cup style they may get warm on your head. I always get a q-tip out and swipe off the sweat condensation that accumulates inside the left ear cup on the plastic ear sensor after workouts (I dont know if this is recommended). I haven't had any issues with them slipping off my head either. The hand and swipe gestures take a little time to get used to however, once you get them down they work well. The hand placement/cover over the right headphone is a cool feature. If in noise cancelling mode it will quickly open up to ambient sound allowing you to quickly and temporarily converse with someone. If you dont want to use that feature you could always leave the speak to chat feature on and it will aggressively switch anytime it picks up speech or laud noises. Along with your purchase of the headphones you receive a nice hard-ish carrying case, charger brick, usb-C cable, and a aux cord. I've used the aux cord quite a bit with my Nintendo switch and it does a great job. Also, the 1000xm4s are very forgiving if you forget to plug them in when running low on power. In 10mins I can quick charge them to last about 10-hours. I think the specs say 3-hours for a 100% charge but I swear I had my headphones fully charged in about 1-hour. They are dual voltage which has been great for traveling abroad. Lastly, you can connect up to two Bluetooth devices which at time. Honestly I didn't think I would even need this feature. However I found out it is very convenient for seamlessly swapping devices or receiving notifications from my phone/watch while connected to my laptop or when I'm bluetooth connected to my switch and i get a phone call. Overall, they are a great pair of headphones but you will take a hit to bank account. I picked up a open box Amazon return which knocked off over $100 on the price and the headphones came without any issues. If you see these on a decent sale I would scoop up a pair. Also if you want more of a punchy bass type headphones I would also recommend XBN-900N which I tested out shortly and you can tell they are more focused on bass bumping. I believe they are significantly cheaper new but don't have all of the same features.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2022",AH4Y52RTEYUMLCRPZVE3UJLJBNRQ,True,29,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R3JI08GCH5LUUQ,B0863TXGM3,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, but several issues make it a no-go for me. Sticking with my Bose QC 35 Series I",Dennis,2,"I have owned the Bose QC 35 series I (the originals) for four years now, and just recently replaced the ear pads since they finally deteriorated. I figured after four years there has to be some serious improvements in noise cancelling technology, and since the WH-1000XM3 model got so many good reviews I figured these would be awesome. So I pre-ordered them.I pulled them out of the box and followed the very quick connect process of downloading the app and using it to pair to my phone. It downloaded a firmware update automatically while I fiddled around with some settings briefly and listened to some music. Super easy, awesome.The sound is very impressive. Punchy kick drum (I listen mostly to rock/metal) and nice bright sound. I quickly settled on a slightly customized version of the included Bright preset.But things quickly went downhill from there.After using the headphones for a bit, the touch controls became frankly annoying and easily susceptible to mistakes (I triggered track skips multiple times just by removing and putting the headphones back on). The volume adjustment is especially tedious...if you want to raise or lower the volume significantly you have to swipe it up or down a large number of times because the volume adjustment is done in small increments. With the Bose QC 35 and its dedicated buttons, you just quickly push the buttons. Simple.I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to pair the headphones with my laptop, reading the guide in the app and doing some web searching, thinking it must be provided by one of the two dedicated buttons like on the Bose QE 35s. Nope. It must be done with the app. In fact, everything has to be done with the app except whatever you have the custom button configured to do, and the power. On the Bose I just have to slide the power button, and it goes into pairing mode. Simple.The above are honestly smaller issues that you could probably put up with since the sound these produce is so good. However, the deal breaker for me was when I connected them with the included wire to the controller on my Roku Ultra to enjoy some TV time after a long day. I always watch movies and TV with headphones. To my horror they produced a clearly audible hissing sound that is incredibly distracting. I turned them off and on again, disconnected and reconnected the cable. No change, still the hissing sound. My Bose don't produce this sound. Ugh.After listening to them for a couple hours I had a slight headache and felt fatigued, almost nauseous. I know some people are affected differently by the noise cancelling technology, but I don't get this from my Bose, even after listening to them all day.Additionally, speaking of noise cancelling, I compared my Bose QC 35s to these, and I couldn't tell the difference between the noise cancelling. They sound the same to me. :shrug: I'm sure you could tell the difference with laboratory equipment though.All-in-all the sound these produce is really good, and the noise cancelling is great (although I can't tell the difference from my Bose QC 35 Series I). But they have 1) lots of annoyances in the touch controls instead of dedicated buttons, 2) the fact that the app is required to do everything (including pairing) except turning them off and activating the custom button, 3) the hissing on the wired connection to my Roku Ultra, and 4) the fatiguing after listening to them.I'll be returning them.","Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2020",AFERWW2A4UHMJIFE23HMMIJL2SXA,True,1915,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R1JJLGFUZ7LMKT,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones I've ever owned but -1 star for several minor usability issues,Tayne,4,"As of about three years ago, I was an earbuds guy. The wireless over-hear headphones I had tried previously never could approximate the kind of audio immersion you get when you wedge little speakers directly into your ear canals. I never found over-hear headphone noise cancellation to work that well - often, turning it on would create more noise than it cancelled, compromising audio quality and, well, just sucking generally. Not to mention the inconsistent and typically non-intuitive affordances for powering on/off, pairing, and controlling playback on these things.But then I picked up a pair of Sony's WH-H900N noise cancelling wireless headphones. I basically fell in love with them on day one and used the heck out of them over the past 3 years. So, now I'm an over-ear headphones guy. Specifically, THIS line of over-ear headphones that Sony is putting out.I still love my H900Ns. But we all know that in tech a lot can change in 3 years time. In fact, I was about to upgrade to the WH-1000XM3s a few months ago but held off after learning about the imminent release of the M4s. So I waited. Then I pre-ordered. Yesterday, I received them.I've now had about 24 hours to toy around with them and I'm already prepared to say that these are clearly the best headphones I've ever owned. Which is to say: They're everything I love about my WH-900Ns, but better:- They're noticeably lighter, and based on about 5 hours of use I'm convinced they're more comfortable to wear- Sound quality is significantly better. I didn't actually expect this amount of improvement, but it's definitely noticeable at both low and high end. Separation of layers is particularly amazing: vocals shine with total clarity, heavy bass tracks shake and vibrate my skull without any noticeable distortion; high-hats and snares are crisp and clear. Very happy with this so far, which i should mention is just using the default settings with songs downloaded from Spotify. I'm looking forward to optimizing further with custom equalizer settings in the sound connect app.- Small thing but the semi-hardshell case with dedicated accessory storage (pictured) is really nice to have (900Ns just came with a bag...)- Clarity of phone calls - both input and output (i.e., the mic works well) - is excellent. This is key as I plan to use these to listen to music and take meetings while WFH for the foreseeable future. The 900Ns were also very good in this regard, but the ability to connect to both my work computer and my mobile device simultaneously will really help me out during the work week.CONNECTING TO TWO DEVICES SIMULTANEOUSLYOne of the issues is figuring out how to connect to these things to two devices at the same time. Given that this is a new and much-anticipated feature, I would have thought Sony would have thought to make it crystal clear to new users how to actually do this. Maybe I missed it, but I couldn't find instructions for how to do this. Here are the steps I discovered through trial and error that allowed me to simultaneously connect to both my iPhone and Mac Mini:1. You may have to enable the feature from within the Headphones mobile app. For me, it was disabled. See photo I uploaded showing the relevant part of the application.2. You need to first pair the headphones to each device separately before it is possible to connect to them simultaneously. As far as I can tell, there is no way to put the headphones in pairing mode when they're connected to a device.3. Then, when the headphones are connected to one of the devices, you should be able to connect your second device to the headphones using the second device's bluetooth preferences.4. If the second device successfully connects, you'll hear a voice notification through the headphones: ""Bluetooth device 2 connected"". You'll also see two devices listed under the ""Status"" tab of the Headphones Connect application.Not a big deal, but seems silly that something like the above wasn't just in Sony's own documentation.OTHER MINOR GRIEVANCES AND NITPICKSIt seems that the only way to get the most out of these is to use them with your Android or iOS device. This is because a lot of functionality - such as the ability to customize sound - is only available on iOS/Android devices with the Sony Headphones Connect application. The iOS app is decidedly intended for use on iPhones - it only runs in portrait orientation, making it a pain to use on my iPad (which I almost always use in landscape orientation). But the worst thing about this is that I can't customize anything when listening on a MacOS device, which these days is a lot of the time. Fortunately, these sound excellent even with the default settings - just wish the capabilities of these headphones wasn't dependent on which device I was using them with.Final minor grievance (for now) is this adaptive sound control feature that Sony got me to try out. It requires location sharing and by default fires annoying and surprisingly frequent notifications on my iPhone about how it's apparently adapting to my ambient environment. I figured out how to mute the notifications but still need to figure out how to shut the feature off entirely, which I frankly have had enough of. My advice is to opt out of this feature when you first set your headphones up. Very disruptive with totally unclear benefits.FINAL WORD (FOR NOW)Again, best headphones I've ever owned, and I'm very happy with my purchase. But the minor issues I describe above, combined with the high cost of these things, were enough to knock a star off my rating. Buyer beware :)","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2020",AGEKBKA2Z63J7U3URXIPCFNZQOGQ,True,382,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

R6SURW0X715LZ,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Noise Canceling is Amazing,KL03,5,"This was my first time using noise canceling headphones and I was amazed by how good the noise canceling was. I put them on while on an airplane and the tight fitting cups sealed around my ears, slightly reducing the noise of the plane. Then I turned on the noise canceling and everything went silent. I had no idea that noise canceling could work this well.I bought the XM4 over the newer XM5 because some reviews said they were better. Overall I'm very happy with them and I will be bringing them with me every time I travel on a plane.Pros:-Excellent noise canceling-Very good battery life. They last much longer than an ipad or phone when watching movies.-Can still be used as regular wired headphones if the battery dies, or if bluetooth isn't an option, like with an airplane screen. I should note that the noise canceling will still work when wired if the battery is good.-Nice small case for travelingCons:-They are kind of small for over the ear style headphones, so you probably won't like them if you have large ears.-Most of the controls aren't actual buttons, so it's hard to figure them out.

R24CNHZWHJRWOV,B0863TXGM3,"3.0 out of 5 stars GREAT for Music -- BAD for Calls, Teams, etc",David Diskin,3,"Because I do so many meetings over Teams (I'm a professional software trainer), I thought it would be time to finally invest in a really good headset. Up until now, I'd been using a $50 over-ear set by MPOW with a really nice boom mic. It was great, but it wasn't wireless, certainly wasn't portable, and didn't have the audio quality I'd want when listening to music.I thought that by splurging more than $300 on a Sony product I'd get something that was beyond all of my expectations. I was almost right, but so very wrong in other ways.CASE: Let's start here. The case is as slim as can be, very high-quality build, looks nice, feels nice, keeps everything protected. Excellent design here with one flaw: you can't really charge the headphones while they're snug in the case; they don't fold up the right way.APP: To use most of the features, Sony requires you to download an app to your smartphone. That wasn't a big deal and the app was easy to figure out. It crashed twice on me (once during the first setup, again the next day). It offered some location-based services but I declined and it never asked me again. It wanted me to sign up for a free trial of some 360° music service -- not sure what that is, but I skipped it. I was disappointed that there wasn't a PC version of the app. For example, if I needed to switch which device the headphones were connected to, I can only do that from my phone -- that means my phone always has to be one of the two devices. There's no way to control the advanced features, or the equalizer, from the PC.PAIRING: Bluetooth pairing was hit or miss, over and over again. If I were only pairing to my phone, I think it would be fine. But I wanted to also pair it to my desktop and laptop. The device supports pairing to two devices at the same time -- which was great -- but nearly every time I wanted to switch devices I had to literally turn off bluetooth so the headset would ""let go"". Other times, upon reconnecting, the mic wouldn't work. Once, which turned out to be the final straw for me, was when I could not get the headset to work in Teams no matter what I tried, even though it worked fine a few hours earlier. (For context: I literally train employees and other trainers on how to use Teams, so I very much know what I'm doing.)SOUND QUALITY: Let me say that the sound quality IS exceptional. I had a blast listening to all my favorite songs streaming from my phone or laptop. I really can't understate the quality, base and treble. And the ANC (active noise cancelling) was AMAZING. I could be sitting right next to a whole house fan and not hear it. I was blown away.RANGE: Twice during the day I tried walking around while on a call. It wasn't until I went downstairs that anyone said the quality of my voice had dropped. If I was less than 25 feet from the device, everything was great.BATTERY LIFE: After a day of use it was down to about 50% and that impressed me. Then I watched TV and ate dinner and later that evening I put on the headphones and realized that the battery dropped to 10%. I thought the system had an auto-off feature but something didn't quite work.CHARGING: So after my surprise drop in battery, I plugged it into my desktop with a USB C cable I already had. A little light on the headset turned red. When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to learn that the headphones were still at 10%. Apparently the USB C cable I use to charge my mouse won't charge the headphones. I guess you need to use the cable it ships with? I'm not sure what the deal was here, but that was pretty annoying.CONTROLS: I found the touch/gesture controls to be mostly intuitive. Pro Tip: If you swipe up and hold your finger, the volume slowly increments up. Once, however, I accidentally hung up a Teams call when I was trying to adjust the volume. I love the feature that let's me hear ambient sound by cupping my hear -- super cool. Tap the power button to hear the battery level -- very nice touch! However, there's one extremely important flaw in the controls that I was shocked to discover. THERE IS NO MUTE BUTTON. The ONLY way to mute your mic during a call (Teams, phone, Zoom, etc) is to use the mute button on the desktop/phone. The headset, whose very first bullet is ""clear hands-free calling"", has five built-in microphones, and a dedicated gesture to use Alexa... doesn't have a damn mute button. Sadly, the successor to this (the 1000XM5) has the same flaw.Individually, the issues I raised wouldn't be enough for me to return the headset or give it a low rating. But for a $350 purchase, I expect it to be able to do what it says correctly. I expect a mute button. I expect it to power off when not in use. I expect any generic USB cable to work. I expect to be able to join a meeting without fussing with bluetooth.I'd totally keep this if all I wanted it for was to listen to music.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2022",AFYFHYV5S7I7LYF7JRA63MPQGDTA,True,30,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

R11GP1556DW75I,B0863TXGM3,"5.0 out of 5 stars Beyond anything I could have imagined...if noise distracts, buy back your productivity!",Mike,5,"I have used active noise canceling technology in protective ear muffs, and I have had some ear buds that were passive noise canceling, so I kind of thought I had an idea what these where going to be like. Nothing could prepare me for my first impression, and we’ll every subsequent impression.My wife does telemedicine from home, and soon we plan to add another dedicated office, but for right now we share a room. The distraction of having a constant conversation in the background has driven me to feel like a nomad - wandering from flat spot to flat spot. The laptop isn’t an issue, but the scanner, 32” monitor, keyboard, keypad, paperwork,etc...well you get the point. So I found a 17” led up in the attic...no go, for the record don’t ever get used to one size monitor than essentially try to get use to one 1/4th that size. I tried listening to music with my passive ear buds, finally I used my protective muffs that I have for mowing, shooting, anything loud and it sort of worked but those try to defeat harmful noise levels. I tried wearing earbuds playing music underneath the muffs and while that worked, my ears however felt like they had been in a vice.Well that leads me to these, while these are more costly than anything I ever have purchased for audio - other than my home theater equipment. Let me say now I’m case I am being wordy, these are worth every penny.I can be attached to both my iPhone and laptop, so I can get feedback from my computer or listen to audio and still here when I get an alert on my phone. When I wish, the head phones do not require any actual music or anything. I literally feel like I am alone in a “cone of silence” for those familiar with the old Get Smart episodes. If my wife or any other family member needs me it is easier to text me than to call out to me. While that is a little inconvenient, my ability to concentrate has increased multi-fold which has also allowed my productivity to feeling a pure joy rather than the stress of always feeling like you need to do more.These are also light, and have no issue navigating by size 8 head. The app setup for these is wild. I have done moldable ear plugs, but I never dreamed I would take a selfie and then snap shots of each ear to customize the sound. The other fascinating thing happened completely by accident, I was listening to a presentation online but needed to work on dinner. I thought I paused the pc and joined on the phone. But evidently I never stopped the pc and hearing audio I didn’t worry about anything. Well I realized that my pc was communicating with the Sony app and the app was evidently acting like a radio repeater...I was out of range of my office but set my phone out of the way where it won’t get wet, dropped or anything else. It was only when I tried to stop the presentation did I realize what had occurred. I now use this all the time and have subsequently learned to pause/play with the controls. Lastly, and this will completely give away the secret that I never read instructions...I could not figure out how to connect a phone call. I used the buttons like I do on my other Bluetooth earbuds, but that didn’t work. I felt stupid when I learned all that I had to do was tap the center of the right muff.I know this is a lot of money, and While it is rare for productivity be literally monetized unless you are on commission, I can tell you that these allow for peace in total chaos...oh, if I had these 20 years ago when our second child was colicky🙂.I normally buy black by default, grey if black isn’t available, but my wife encouraged me to try the blue. While I am color blind, I still see color, amd like the blue...my wife also likes the color which is way more important. I am starting to sense that I will be buying another pair of these for my wife because when she is charting on her EMR distractions are awful.","Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2021",AGR7CTQV4ETCIWAPZDP42W5V6EQA,True,3,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only

R3D37IETBXFZQP,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Bluetooth Headphones I've had so far...,Daniel Meadows,5,"I have purchased and used a variety of wireless, over-ear style headphones over the years, but the Sony WH-1000XM4 (XM4's from here on), have provided a great experience so far! For simplicity's sake, I will only directly mention the other Sony pair I currently own, the XB900N.Note:This review is after one full (out of the box) charge. They lasted almost exactly three days after fairly heavy use. Material used during this period varied from heavy rock to classical, audiobooks, and videos from YouTube. Sections in the review are in CAPS for organization, not emphasis.The Positive:+ SOUND is phenomenal on these. Out of the box, they were almost on par with other sets I had set equalizer preferences for. Once the equalizer profiles were created for the XM4's, the music started sounding better than it ever has before through Bluetooth. These clearly favor a warm sound, and shine best when paired with bass heavy tracks, but all of my library has gotten some noticeable benefit from the XM4's.Sound is different for everyone, but these seem better out of the box than most I've tried, and custom profiles are easy to create with the Sony app.+ CONNECTIVITY was extremely easy. I had already installed the Sony companion app for headphones from the XB pair I had used before. I have not had any dropped connections so far.+ BUILD QUALITY feels like a pretty big step up from the XB900N's. Sturdy cans and a very soft headband are a nice combination. I've only had the XM4's for three days but I feel they will hold up fairly well. Considering I've had the XB pair for over a year with no noticeable degradation, I have high expectations here. The XM4's come with a great travel case too.The Neutral (still positive to me):1. CHARGING CORD is short. I like it because it is now the easiest charging cord to identify out of all the ones I currently use. The cord it is packaged with limits flexibility for charging locations, but is also perfectly functional for my needs.2. ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) function is good, almost too good. I have used these headphones a lot since I received them three days ago, and the first thing I noticed when I put them on- the ANC was overwhelming. I became somewhat queasy as soon as I turned them on. Once I opened the app I noticed there was a calibration tool for ANC. Once I went through that process, I no longer felt discomfort when using this feature. YMMV, but these block out most noise in my home, to the point it's just music or the book I'm listening to. I'm still getting used to how strong the ANC actually is.3. BATTERY LIFE was pretty good, but may have been somewhat under 100% out of the box, despite the headphones declaring a full charge when activated. I did not time my usage, but I probably got around 18 to 20 hours on the initial charge. Some settings for music quality and DSEE (sound enhancement for some content) will lower battery life according to Sony's companion app. It advised against using my settings for the best battery life experience. I appreciated but also ignored this advice. I know I won't be getting the full battery life from it, but it sounds so good! I'm leaving this detail under neutral to see if I get the same- or better - performance from a true 100% charge. Edit: lasted about the same, maybe one additional hour. Still good for daily, heavy use.4. TOUCH CONTROLS are a big debate among users of Bluetooth headphones. I happen to like how responsive these are, but I've also really liked some other headphones out there that had good old fashioned dials and buttons. I don't know which I prefer over the other, but the touch controls for the XM4's are not bad.The Negatives:- These get pretty warm. Ultimately, it isn't an issue to me because I wear glasses and they are still comfortable, just warm after longer sessions.Overall:The best Bluetooth headphones I've come across! Definitely worth the price on sale. The XM4's do not disappoint and provide truly top-tier ANC functionality. My new favorite headphones for music and audiobooks on the go.Thank you for reading my review!Hopefully the XM4's are finished recharging by now.Have a great day!","Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2021",AFXQD236J4IAIPMMDUVPGYEZ6PNA,True,43,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R161CZ0PS65QJQ,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars I love these headphones! The best!!!!!,Janel MH,5,"So let's get the cons out of the way: pricey, but worth it!If hooking up Bluetooth headphones through a Bluetooth transmitter (for me I use one for my tv that doesn’t have Bluetooth), have to not download headphone app and make sure your phone doesn’t hook up to it via phone Bluetooth and you need to “forget this device” on your phone.For me I am not going to use these with my iPhone, so I deleted the app and did as above so my phone wouldn’t detect it, otherwise it’s hard to get it to connect to the transmitter. I don’t need the app that Sony suggests to download anyway because that is just for ambient and sound control/extras. More convenient if you do use headphones with your phone.Any more cons? I can think of any!Pros: a lot! I love these. I previously purchased cheap Bluetooth headphones from Amazon but wish I have got these sooner. The cheaper ones are ok but the ear pads hurt my ears after wearing them after an hour or two.I’ve only used these Sony headphones a couple times but after an hour my ears don’t hurt! The earpads are comfortable and fit over my ears well.As I said before, it’s easy to connect via Bluetooth transmitter(or whatever blue tooth you are hiking up to) after I deleted the app, if I want to watch tv.It’s hard to tell in the instructions with no words(I guess a con) but I looked it up in you tube, and while the headphones are on, press and hold (the on/off button)until the voice lady says Bluetooth pairing. This is a good tip because I didn’t get that right away. And then it connected!Was easy to reconnect as well using it another day.I can also listen to my tv and have the noise cancelling on and the same time! It’s great! I don’t even hear any traffic from outside or if someone has their subwoofer on in their car! It’s a game changer and a life saver.The noise cancelling is great in general also. And can be turned off if needed by pressing the button over the on/off button. Can also be switched to ambient sound.Overall these are the best headphones I’ve had. And totally forgot how good Sony was. I know back in the day I had a Walkman and cd Walkman and they were the bras knees. The Sony brand has always been good. They are still the best for electronics in my opinion.Another con I just thought of is the changes cord could be longer.Pro: comes with a nice fabric case and plug if if you want it wired an adapter for airplanes, etc.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AGMSTFZ2H4KOB6D42AJN6YH7U6FA,True,10,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only

I could squabble and compare differences with the price range. But once you put them on turn on all the features and block out the world 🌎 come on ... the are perfect. Just like all others in the same price range... put them on and let the world wash away. OR ... scenario 2 ... you need to block out noise at work and make clear phone calls or still talk to others, BAM! block out the world and conquer 💪 it at the same time! Outstanding noise canceling and calling 📞 and you can be in a room with noisy equipment and have your music or phone call whisper quiet. It's a delight 😊As far as music you can have clean and bright and great bumping bass with out being harsh you can get as Hi-Res as you wish with Sony. It's excellent for everyone from Miles Davis to Marshall MathersAs a bonus, the battery lasts all day. It doesn't take much time to get a good charge out of it. When I use it for half a day with all the goodies turned on, it's down to about 70% by lunch. I charge it at lunch and it's 90% to 100% full. By the way, it only has one seemingly slow speed to charge. However, it only takes a little bit of charge for a whole lot of battery life. Check with Sony or the interwebz for actul ratio.","Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2024",AEJQKIB2YJCVZOOET7EFJB7MCBRA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

R2CNHE70MV5YQL,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Sometimes drops connection,H. T.,5,"Drops the Bluetooth connection occasionally, but this could be due to the TV not having a resident Bluetooth capability, so I have to use a bluetooth dongle. Also, once the connection is lost you may have to totally shut everything off, then restart. Not easy to increase the volume using the headphone by sweeping up on the right earmuff, just use the TV volume buttons. Otherwise seems to be well made and the should is an improvement over the TV speakers. Mine is an older Sony TV. Also interesting, when the headphones are removed but still on the sound will diminish to 0 and when the headphones are replaced the should comes back on...Amazing...but then I am an elderly man... so a lot of this is Sci Fi stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AGBACYPBVYH65GCJHQ6RNS3IOBEA,True,0,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only
R1S3V4WDHX03DB,B0863TXGM3,3.0 out of 5 stars Really nice phones but not for me,Leon,3,"I really wanted to like these headphones and was super disappointed that they didn't work out. The earcups were super comfortable, the noise cancelling was perfect and I couldn't hear anything when it was one and loved that I could connect to my phone and computer at the same time not having to waste time changing over from one thing to another but the thin band on the top just hurt my head way too much.I tried to do all the things people suggested like put a wrap around it or change the positioning of the headphones but nothing worked for me. After about 30 minutes I would start to get a headache and I couldnt handle wearing them anymore. It was a real bummer because so many people suggested these. I even tried wearing a hat and beanie but that seemed to make it worse.When they go on sale they are great for the price but for me they for sure were not it. If Sony made the band wider or the cushion thicker or something that would have made them the most perfect cans, but I could not hang with that thin ass band over my head at all.Really don't know how people handle it. It's not like I have an odd shaped head or anything either. I'd understand if my top of my head was more rounded but nope the band is just thin as hell.

R2SUXCOAV9YSTQ,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent headphones with minor complaints,Joe k,4,"So I am coming from the Bose QC II, which I thoroughly enjoyed. So that will be the headphones ill compare these to. In terms of sound quality they are pretty neck and neck in this category, but I will give the slight advantage to the Sony headphones because they have an EQ on the app. The Bose headphones I felt had better highs, whereas the Sony headphones have much better lows. the mids really are not that much different in my opinion, although I'm not the best judge because I've only ever really used Beyerdynamics dt770s, so I'm not an audiophile by any means.If you listen to hiphop most of the time like I do, these headphones are great and much preferred over the Bose because of a significantly more punchy bass, like seriously, the Bose hardly have bass. However it isn't just hiphop, I also listen to electronic and a lot of fantasy music, like movie and game soundtracks. And these are fantastic for both.Next I will talk about comfort, this is one of the things I dislike about the Sony headphones, but also, this is entirely preference and head shape dependent. I noticed with the Sony headphones the top part of the headphone will hurt the top of my head in a much shorter time than the Bose headphones. Also the ear cups aren't the most comfortable, as I can feel my ears pressed up against the inside of the cups. In my opinion the Bose headphones are more comfortable here, especially over longer periods of time(I wear these headphones at least 6 hours everyday) But that's not to say the Sony headphones are not comfortable, they are very comfortable, more comfortable than my Beyerdynamic dt770 to be honest. They are just not as good as the Bose QC II's, but both are fantastic in this department. I'm not saying the Sony headphones are uncomfortable, I'm just saying they are more uncomfortable than the Bose headphones in my opinion.Next is design and color. So I really really like the color on the Sony headphones, the greyish looks so clean, and id be lying if I said that was not part of the reason why I switched. In terms of looks I love the Sony headphones way more. They just appeal to me more than the more egg shape Bose QC II's. Also the weight of the headphones is about the same, I think maybe the QC II's were slightly lighter, but its not an issue by any means, they are both really light.One of the things I hate most about the Sony headphones is the touch functionality, its a nuisance, to say the least. To the point where I actively try to avoid using the touch functions, like volume up, down, next song, previous, pause, etc. This is a prime example of putting unnecessary tech functions on a product, sort of like how they put tablets on a fridge now--like why? I way prefer the physical buttons on the QC II's. But I always wear an apple watch, and always have my phone on me so its pretty easy for me to change volume and songs on my watch/phone. But still, on the Bose headphones, I used the physical buttons all the time.A lot of times I will accidently pause the song by readjusting the headphones(readjusting needs to happen semi-frequently when wearing them at the gym), also if I try to use the touch controls --because for some reason I always think maybe this time it will be different. It usually ends up with me accidently swiping forward instead of up which will change the song. It is incredibly frustrating.Battery life is next, and Sony wins by 10 hours here, these are insane. 30 hours is great battery life, and it charges with USB-C rather than the older usb ports on the bose. No complaints here.Honestly, Its sort of hard to give these 4 stars, because they really are incredible, but I think because of the incredibly frustrating touch functionality, and the slightly uncomfortable ear cups I have to dock a star, if I could dock half I probably would, 4.5 is a pretty accurate rating, I would give these a 5 stars if they just removed the touch controls, and fixed the earcups somehow.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2021",AFVRXTQ5UZV3R4X6CIHDRIC676HQ,True,2,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only

R3V25GSVN3M9AR,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars UPDATED: Excellent sound & Comfort, Subpar Ergonomics, Auto-Shut Off Does Not Work as Expected",Richard N. Barg,4,"Note: this review is substantially changed. I forgot to proofed the initial review.I also own a pair of Bose QC 35s. The XM4s are definitely more comfortable and easier to wear for a longer period of time. They have less clamping and carbon pressure than the QC 35s, which really surprised me. I owned the XM-3s briefly before returning them. The XM4s, in my view, are considerably more comfortable, especially the headband which no longer exerts a downward force. The QC-35s, still being sold, seem ancient. I have also tried the somewhat polarizing Bose 700s. I’m not a fan, but concede, for phone calls, they are revolutionary in the way they use microphones to produce a clear sound even in noisy environments.The DSEE Extreme audio enhancement option does wonders for the sound, especially on audiobooks and podcasts. The rest of the app is spartan and lackluster.The XM4s device pairs very well with Bluetooth (BT) devices such as my iPhone and iPad, now simultaneously although you do lose the ability to use certain Codecs. BT on the XMS blow away the QC 35s in terms of initially connectivity, notably speed, have superior distance/range and duration of Bluetooth signal. Dropouts even next to the microwave oven, are minimal. The ability to connect two devices simultaneously to BT is a game-changer and a massive upgrade from the XM3s.The chat to talk function is useless and annoying and easy to accidentally turn on.The XM4 ssuffer from a lack of dedicated volume control dials. Car manufacturers removed this feature on their Infotainment system, notably Honda, and customers rightly pushed back. And now the volume controls dials are back. The Bose QC-35s, whatever it other shortcomings and dated design, have dedicated rocker switches that are far superior to the touchpad on the XM4s. Among other things they don’t beep when you raise or lower the volume. That beep is annoying and interferes with what you were listening to.In windy or rainy condition, the touchpad is unreliable, often activated by gusts and raindrops with unexpected results. With inclement weather and outdoors, I fall back to my trusty QC-35s.The touchpad suffers from another vice. You can easily invoke fast forward or rewind instead of the touchpad volume controls if your finger lands in the wrong place, which happens periodically by the law of averages. If you are an older adult whose hand motor skills have declined, have tremor, or Parkinson’s, by all means disable the touchpad. I find it somewhat difficult to easily orient the headphones, that is to quickly glean which is the left for the right ear cup when putting them on. Sony could have done a better job with a more conspicuous visual indicator.The phone call experience on the XM4s is superior to the Bose Q3-35s, but substantially inferior to the Bose 700s which blow away all the competition (Full disclosure - have not tested Apple’s new headphones). The active noise canceling on the XM4s seem superior to the Bose QC35s. The use of USB-C to charge the headphones is a vast improvement on Micro-USB.Sony has been, at a minimum, disingenuous, and arguably actively misleading the consumer in representing that the XM4s have auto-shut-off when that feature is enabled. In fact, auto-shut-off ONLY disables the noise canceling feature, which saves battery life, but does NOT turn off but the headphones. If you don’t remember to manually turn them off, you will invariably be greeted at some point with an inopportune “low battery” warning. Sony can and should do better. There is no reason the feature cannot work as represented.The Bose QC 35s, by contrast have a well-implemented auto-shut-off. And its very quick to manually turn them off with a rocker switch. With the XM4s, you have to hold down a button for an interminable 2-3 seconds. I simply plug in my XM4s to USB-C every night to ensure I have a charged set of headphones, How this will affect the battery life long-term is unknown.The XM4 case works, but is a bit weird. You have to do through numerous contortions to fold the headphones in such a way that they fit in the case. The cutout guides are so some helps, but overall the case on the QC-35s is simpler and allows for quickly storing them. The zipper on the Sony XM4s is of an inferior quality and often hangs, requiring you back up the zipper forward progress and start again.Thus I heartily recommend the XM4s, but with some reservations.","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2021",AHCZHHNMP4MTYNJLGUE4UHGPLLBA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

Take your hand away, and noise cancelling resumes.2) Music stops playing / pauses when you remove them and resumes when you put them back on (as long as it isn't too long. They do shut off automatically after a certain amount of time)3) I can be hooked up to my phone and computer at the same time4) Ambient sound mode really magnifies the sound around you, which is sometimes very beneficial5) Very comfortable on the head6) Swiveling ear pieces that fold in. This is why I went with the 4 and not the 57) Noise cancellation.

R3SXVEP7ZDKCSF,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars My Take,Amazon Customer,4,"The Sony WH-1000XM4’s is a comfortable pair of headphones, designed for comfort, convenience, and to provide a whole new hearing experience with music and audio. Its base focus is ergonomic meaning it has adjustable bands, a comfortable padding, and smart controls that you can customize to suit your preferences. In March 2021, I was searching for a new pair of headphones for my birthday and this happened to come up. At that time it was priced around $300 but I did some further research and thought that these headphones would be a good investment because for one; I like to listen to music and two; I loved the features.Some of the strong aspects of the Sony WH-1000XM4 include the smart features, the app, customizable controls, battery life, and an ergonomic design for comfort. The smart controls can also be connected with the Sony Headphones App and it can also connect up to two devices at once. There is also a speak-to-chat function meaning that if you are wearing the headphones with music on and you start to talk to someone, it will automatically pause the music for you. Once you stop talking, it will resume the music. Besides this, it also has an ambience, normal, and noise-cancelling mode. It can be switched with the side button. Another one of its strengths is that these headphones have the ability to read the environment. When I used to ride my bike to the park while listening to music, they would switch to ambience mode for me to hear the cars and the music would be on low. As for the customizable controls, you can control the sound elements that you want either to be higher or lower within the app to maximize your listening experience. They also have some presets available but I usually stick with the ones I customize. I used them almost everyday and these are the most comfortable headphones so far. The hold is not too tight or loose. They also have Google Assistant and Alexa Built-In. But my most favorite part about these headphones is that I can change the track, change the volume, or make calls with just a tap or swipe on the right ear. The paddings are comfortable. The battery life on these are 30 hours and just charging for 10 minutes will give you 5 hours.Despite these strengths, there are also some flaws. Sometimes when I talk to someone, having the music stop can become annoying. But I changed the controls in the app so that it does not pause the music. Another flaw is that the microphone on these headphones are not good. I heard that from most of my friends, it sounds muffled and unclear. I have to carry the Apple Wired Earphones if I have a meeting to join because the microphone quality on those are better than the Sony WH-1000XM4 (though I heard that the newest one 1000XM5’s have a better microphone). However, I think it is partially my fault for not setting up the microphone. I also wished they came in more colors.Overall, these are one of the top industries’ best headphones. It is a great investment that will improve your audio/music experience. I recommend it to those who have to study a lot, travel a lot, or maybe those who like to up their music game. For the final grade, I give it an A. Depending on what you look for in headphones, the Sony WH-1000XM4’s are a good investment that will bring value to your lifestyle. Wear it with an outfit and it will also become part of the look.","Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2023",AE3XOTZX4POH3IUEKKHWWSFNO4GQ,True,4,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
R3SAGQ8WM36T2B,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound - 1st Class Noise Cancelling,Eyeconic,5,"First a side note. Do NOT order this item for overnight delivery. It is a password protected delivery which means that someone will be at your door at 4:00 AM asking for the magic incantation.I have the comparable Sony earbuds so I knew what to expect. Others will have to contend with micro-printed docs on 5 lb paper and a weird wordless diagram which requires a translation from pantomime to one's native language. HOWEVER, the Sony website has ample documentation in a readable format. Also, you need the Sony headphone app to fine tune the setup.I have acute PTSD, a consequence of gun violence. My building is undergoing major construction in th4e form of concrete restoration. I suspect that, for most people, the noise from the machines is a mere inconvenience. For me that is not the case. It's a pile driver inside my head.My earbuds were doing the job (these products have the best noise-cancelling of any device I have tried). However, they have limited battery life. The headphones solve that problem. I CANNOT HEAR A SOUND FROM THE CONSTRUCTION. Moreover, I have modest hearing loss in one ear. Hearing aids balance things out and the headphone can be worn over the aids.I have a large music collection (mostly jazz and classical) ripped losslessly (flac) to large USB drives. The drives are attached to an Nvidia Shield Pro which is an Android TV device. Bluetooth paired right up, has decent range (not requiring LOS) and connects via LDAC (which is what you want for the best quality). I then use Kodi for playback of music and movies.On the left side is an on-off button and another button that can be programmed via the app. On the right, the side of the speaker is actually a mouse pad which allows you to control both volume and your player (Kodi is imperfect in that regard but it works fine with the app on my phone).The music is flat AS IT SHOULD BE. Competing devices seem to be made for the average 16-year-old, artificially pumping up the bass. If unnatural noise is what you want, there are plenty of IOS and Android equalizer apps. In any event Mr. Mozart sounds like he should. Most jazz includes a bass that comes through exactly as it would in a live performance. Well, not exactly because we experience bass physically as well as through hearing.One final note. These things are big. I have an average-sized head (something my former employees would disagree with). The earpieces are not extended at all and the thing is a bit bigger than my headspace. Also, I wish that they were just a tad lighter.So, in the final analysis, these offer excellent sound reproduction that is accurate, rich and natural. The controls (which include a mouse pad on the right speaker) allow you to control your device and volume. The noise cancellation could not be better. There are no compromises making this a reasonable value.","Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2023",AGUUWIFY7DIFIWQRWV2JKBCOWEIQ,True,71,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only

R1RRDWF3JCZOPG,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars What world?,FaTHoM,5,"After buying the WF-10000XM4's and losing the case (replacement is $150. I paid $225 ish for the set), I thought I'd give the WH's a try. I got them for $228 or so, so opted to not get the XM5's due to the price difference. I've only had them for barely a week, but my initial thoughts are certainly positive.Fit. Here's the deal, I have some big ears, with 3/4"" gauges. With my gauges in, I do get some pain in my neck. I have pain issues, so this was no surprise, nor is it a fault of the design. My ears fit fairly comfortably inside the cups to help lock out sound, minus the gauges. The polypropylene(?) material is quite soft and moldable, making wearing them for an hour or more easy and comfortable.I have a kinda funny shaped head (IMO. But I'm highly critical of myself and the world), but these look really slick placed on my dome. I got black, because black goes with everything, and I don't wear color. Look and fit much better than cans I've owned in the past.Noise cancelation. The ANC is good, but not great. I found the ANC on the WF's more thorough, which is a bit odd considering they're earbuds. However, they do form a more legit seal in the ear canal, so it could be that. There is some ""hissing"", but part of that is also my tinnitus. I find that there seems to be some slight hissing even with the ANC off. It's akin to being in a super silent room, and you hear the ""hissing"" from an AV system with it powered on, but with no sound. I've not flown with them yet (Which is a huge reason why I got these), but I assume they'll be just fine for passenger and engine noise.Sound quality. So, I'm pre-burn in on the drivers. There is usually 100 hours or so of burn in on every new speaker/driver on the planet, and these are no different (I have not researched this in actuality. I was in AV for several years, and have some knowledge). But, so far, they sound very pleasant and accurate. I opted for an EQ setting (Excited) just to bring out certain details in the instrumental/electronic music I'm currently listening to. You can hear the trilling of the tongue on a flute, and the fingers against guitar strings. The detail is fairly rich, while maintaining a fairly neutral overall tone. The sounds seem to be reproduced fairly accurately and are fantastic for instrumenal music.For the price I paid, these are great. However, for the normal asking price of around $350, I expect the soundstage and sound field to be superior to what it is. It is evident that you are hearing music played through 2 speakers often times, instead of an amalgamation of speakers 180 degrees in front of you, or listening to a live performance where the sound comes from everywhere. Think of this as 3D sound if you will, similar to Dolby Atmos. I understand they have the real 3d audio whatever, but right out of the box, they should be fully immersive.Battery life/Bluetooth. Battery life seems to be ok with ANC on. I use ANC exclusively because I like to drown out reality while listening, especially during meditation. I suspect you could easily get 8 hours of consistent listening with ANC on before needing to recharge, which is plenty for half the flights on this side of the world (North America). What else can I say about battery life??Bluetooth connectivity is very strong and nearly instant. I can walk from my apartment to my neighbors apartment with my phone in my apartment and still have unbroken connectivity. THAT is freakin awesome.Overall, I'm very pleased with these cans, especially for the price I got them at. At the normal asking price, I'd recommend checking out the XM5's since their so similarly priced. If you're looking for a solid set of cans, and these are on sale, don't mess around, just buy them. You won't be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2022",AEZI5ES3LFYNSNHLSU3EN4T3SC6A,True,164,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
RBAZBP0AEJ7MI,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars A Bargain at this Price point,Theraphosa,5,"I've had these earphones for a month now and I feel like they are the best noise cancelling headphones I have ever owned. My previous ones were an older model Bose and then a comparable Sennheiser.My job requires that I do inspections in various industrial facilites.My initial work is about five hours in an office, but the decibel level is still around 70dB. At that level, the Sony WH-1000XM4 remove about 95% of the ambient noise. Music, computer videos and telephone conversations are excellent. These headphones are very good at that level.I next spend up to four hours inspecting out of the equipment floor. The noise level varies from around 78dB to 82dB. Not painfully loud, but it can cause short term hearing damage in short sessions, but 5hrs/day on a regular basis can permenantly affect your hearing. To give you a reference point, you would have to shout at someone standing about 3ft away for them to understand you. So it's not jet engine loud, but it's uncomfortable and in addition to hearing damage, long term exposure can raise your blood pressure and cause other negative effects on your physical and mental health. And yet, the level at which OSHA requires hearing protection is 85dB.All this is to say that I take sound cancellation seriously, and I also take my music seriously too. These earphones are great on both fronts. I'm very comfortable at work and I can listen to my playlists and don't feel as if I have to turn up the volume to drown out the noise of the machinery. It's really pretty cool.My total shift is about ten hours, and I feel no discomfort wearing these over my ears. I'm also bald, and there is plenty of padding on the band where it contacts the top of my head. I'm very happy with these, and even though I've spent more for earphones, I've never had a better pair for my needs.The only downside is that they are not great when using them to make phone calls in a loud enviroment. I honestly didn't expect them to function great in that respect, but it would have been great if they did.The app has numerous ways to customize your experience. More than I actually use. The adaptive sound kept changing the noise cancellation as I moved, so I turned it off. The Speak to Chat feature could be handy, but I occasionally sing along with my music and it would switch off the cancellation. So I turned that feature off also.PROS:Very comfortable to wear for hours at a time.Very good sound cancellation.Love that they pause the playback when you remove the headphones.Great that just holding a hand over the right ear cup will turn off cancellation so you can have a conversation without removing your earphones.Very good music reproduction. Bass is not quite true, but if it was really pronounced, I could adjust the equalizer.The app is very good and has a lot of features, I was pleasantly surprised even though I don't need or use many of them. It's very helpful.Love the ability to stay connected to two devices at the same time. My phone and my computer work well with the earphones.Cons:Sometimes I wish they were a little more snug (maybe I have a small head?)The app is almost TOO helpful. It can take some trial and error to get everything set up as you like it.I would prefer a more tactile controls. These require that you sweep a finger over the outside of the ear cup for volume and track control. It's actually very accurate, but I would still appreciate something that I could use while wearing gloves.Overall, these are a total win, and a bargain at the price. You could probably get something just a shade better, but it would be at a significantly higher price. These are perfect for me and my situation. I would defintely buy them again.","Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2024",AGLZUTDNQGTB7SYDWEKICNA7753Q,True,158,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R3KUVE2FMT9FBG,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for the casual user,Brianna Paige,5,"I purchased these recently while they were on sale intending to use them while I work from home and listen to music, podcasts, or take a work call. They can dually connect to both my computer and phone as I often switch between the two as I'm working. But the switch is not as great or seamless as it could be, sometimes it struggles, causing me to miss something being said at the beginning of the meeting when crossing over from one Bluetooth connection to the other. Pausing whatever device is actively playing media, then switching starting a call, or playing a video on that second device is a lot more seamless this way. Upon first use I was actually surprised by how light the headphones were and how comfortable the padding on these were, but I will say after wearing them for nearly 8 hours, I did notice a little bit of soreness around the tops of my ears but it's nothing compared to what ear buds feel like and what other headphones feel like only 2-3 hours. I cannot really speak on the audio quality as I'm not necessarily a huge expert in that area and I'm largely deaf in one of my ears so half of this pair of headphones is pretty much usless to me... none the less, it sounds great to me, great clear, crisp audio. And I will make note that coworkers that I had to speak on the phone with many times previously and always struggled to understand, regardless of if I have the call on private mode and turned all the way up, speakerphone, or earbuds. But with taking phone calls with these headphones I do not notice this same issue. To mention being largely deaf in one of my ears, these headphones do have a noise canceling features, and although I don't need too much help in the noise canceling area... I can attest that I feel almost completely deaf with these headphones on. Even with other noise canceling headphones, I can hear myself typing on my keyboard, or the sound of resonance of my feet hitting the ground while walking with headphones on, but I do not experience those things with these headphones at all. And so far from about a week and a half of use, the battery life has been great so far, and I am seeming to get about a day and a half (~12 to 14 hours give or take) of battery life from one charge before I get the battery low message, that is when decide to charge mine, but I'm sure you'd still have a good amount of charge left. Also, the case that these headphones come in, and are stored in, is so amazing and such good quality. I always return them to their case after I'm done using them for the day, as the case is strong is really helps keep your headphones safe and protected. I have a habit of throwing my headphones into a bag if I feel like I may want them, but in that bag is also so many other things, and I never worry about my headphones because of how sturdy and strong the case for these are.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AHQ3WVHPXPAGF3B6JGBUXTZ2H7AA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
RN9CWLAVNRL0V,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Better Than XM5,b,5,"**Disclaimer: I bought mine used like new through AmazonI originally purchased the Sony XM5 because they were soooo highly rated in every article I read. I returned the XM5, got the XM4 and am so much happier. I'll compare the XM4 to the XM5, Apple AirPods Max, and Bose QuietComfort 45 - just to help anyone choosing between them.**Noise Cancellation (4.5/5): the noise cancellation on the XM4 is crazy, almost comparable to the Apple AirPods Max. I gave the XM4 a 4.5 because I still think the Apple AirPods Max have the best noise cancellation, but the Sony XM4 is very close. I also like the fact that you can turn noise cancelling on/off with a button - which is a feature not available with the Bose QuietComfort 45. The noise cancellation is much better than the XM5 and less finicky. An issue with the XM5 is that the noise cancelling would just randomly turn on/off. Like if I paused a video for a little too long, the noise cancellation would just turn off Overall, I wouldn't say I it blocks out all sound, but it's close. I can hear the sound of people talking and music, but it's quieter and I can't make out the words. I definitely can't have a conversation with them on. Also, the XM4 will pick up on when you're talking to people and turn the noise cancelling off for you - but it does make a little announcement when it does that may be annoying or disruptive.**Sound Quality (4/5): the sound quality is great. Way better than the XM5, not as great as the Apple AirPods Max. I think the Apple headphones are just a little crisper. I think it's cool that you can turn 360 sound on, but tbh I never really use it (XM5 also has this feature). The sound is clear, and I haven't experienced any malfunctions/issues with the noise. When I had the XM5, they would just randomly sound muffled (like I was underwater) and, when that wasn't happening, the sound quality was mediocre.**Comfort (5/5): the XM4s are REALLY comfy. I wear glasses with plastic frames and a lot of headphones just don't work and are really uncomfy. The Apple AirPods Max were really uncomfortable with my glasses. Obviously, an easy solution is to just wear contacts, but I hate wearing my contacts for long periods of time - especially, when I study/do work. The XM5 were also pretty comfortable, but wouldn't stay fixed when I adjusted them - they would slip and I would need to readjust them a lot. The XM4 completely cover my ear and the ear pads are soft. They don't squeeze my head the way other headphones do and they don't hurt any part of my ear. I will say that the headband part that rests on top of my head does kind of hurt my head after wearing them for almost 10 hours. Also, I have TMJ so sometimes wearing the headphones does cause my TMJ to flare up and I'll switch to earbuds. But, I think overall these are the most comfortable headphones I have tried.**Product Quality (3.5/5): let's be honest, they're plastic and they feel plastic. They don't feel like super high quality, but let me tell you that they feel way better quality than the XM5 - those felt like a barbie toy. I think the XM4 are sturdy and pretty durable. The Apple AirPods Max are also plastic, but do feel a little more high quality - but also, nothing spectacular.**Aesthetic (3.5/5): If the aesthetic is important to you, I would say they look fine. They're a little bulky, but not terrible. Not as sleek as some others, but they don't look ridiculous. If you're really against a bulky look, then they may not be a great aesthetic match for you. I was worried they would be really clunky, but after getting them and wearing them for a bit, I really don't think they look bad.**Connectivity (4/5): I only have Apple devices (iPhone, MacBook, etc.) and I think the connectivity is great with these products! When I got the XM5, they had so many connection issues. I wasn't able to connect them to my laptop, they wouldn't stay connected to my devices - it was a mess. I was really worried I would have the same issues with the XM4, but I have had no problems so far. I will say it was a little odd to have have to download the Sony Connect app and manage the headphone through that platform, but it's user friendly and it's kind of nice to have a control for them (it's almost like a remote).**Battery Life (5/5): The battery life is insane. I've had them for 8 days and have not charged them yet - they still have about 40% charge left. They will turn off automatically to save battery life if you don't use them for a certain amount of time, which I personally like.OVERALL (4.5/5): I think the XM4 are great headphones for a better price than the Apple AirPods Max. The Bose are apparently really similar, but I've never personally tried them. The XM4 is MUCH better than the XM5 in terms of quality and price. They're comfy, great noise cancellation and sound quality, and have great battery life.","Reviewed in the United States June 20, 2023",AFWRUIE4QDPQYPQOK3LVEKELRT4A,True,829,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
R1U65T3UFWZLG4,B0863TXGM3,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Product, Great Customer Service - Best Overall Headphones",Lio,5,"Customer Service: 5/5I purchased this item on Amazon through the seller Focus Camera.The pair I received had a volume defect that effected one side of the headphones constantly making it louder. After some firmware updates and messing with EQ, it was apparent that this was a manufacturer issue. However, when I went to try to initiate the return Amazon was only giving me the option of a full refund when I wanted an exchange. I then reached out to the seller who initiated an exchange for me without any further questions asked - In fact, I was surprised to have the shipping label in their initial reply.Product: 5/5Now that I have a new functioning unit, I can say these are some of the best all-around headphones available right now.As an Apple AirPods Pro user - and like many of you - I was discouraged at the price of Apple’s first branded headphone. No matter the quality, many of us can’t justify that price.I’ve been looking for a pair of wired-headphones for gaming use, video editing use (wired-in editing is the best for sound editing precision), and of course casual music listening use.As far as features, the gesture controls have worked accurately for me and I’ve welcomed the volume control which isn’t a feature on AirPods/AirPods Pro. Their companion app with built in EQ and detailed setting is a God-send for us Apple users who want more customization options in their products. The battery is as long as advertised and it’s nice knowing you don’t have to charge them daily (with my use). Speak-to-Chat is a great idea that has some real-world use cases. Noise Cancellation is probably the best in this mid-tier range of headphones. But if listening to your surroundings is most important to you be aware that the microphones used to listen to your environment - “Ambient Sound” Mode - seem to be located near the top of each headphone can and this appears to face up, as a result the ambient mode is not as effective as Apple’s AirPods Pro’s Transparency Mode (which I’ll assume that the same quality extends to the AirPods Max). The AirPods replicate your surrounding sounds perfectly in real-life quality as if you didn’t have anything in/on your ears. So big FYI; Apple is still king in “Transparency/Ambient” modes. Lastly, they’re extremely comfortable although your ears might get a little warm from the leatherette after prolonged use.I think price is important when considering the review of anything because it determines value. I bought these on sale for $278. With the price being so close to Apple AirPods Pro at $250, I personally feel I’m getting more than my money’s worth with a travel case, 3.5mm audio cable, charging cable, and airplane audio adapter all included with the cost at a great deal. These have a retail price of $350. So, given all of the above and the sound quality, I wouldn’t be particularly enthused or feeling like I got a great deal if I paid full-price for them but the convenience and rich sound make it a good investment nonetheless and almost all owners will be happy with them. But, I hope you understand that that means if these are on sale (especially for $250) then don’t even think about it. It’s a no-brainer Purchase them right away if you see them on sale!Lastly: Sound - The sound is great and highly customizable but the headphones themselves seem to lean towards warmer tones and more bass. Don’t worry, they’re not maxed out like the early-model Beats, but I recommend each user download their companion app and try EQ for the perfect balance. As long as you are aware that these aren’t the audiophile headphones for mixing professional music or films, nor the pair of workout/gym headphones, nor even the pair with noise cancellation that will make you sound like you’re in a soundproof room - then you’ll be happy. These headphones will not excel in any of these specific features, but that’s what makes these headphones the best over-all headphones. It’s a jack-of-all trades and so far one of my favorite Sony products ever made. I hope you enjoy yours as I’ve enjoyed mine.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2021",AFPLI4FFCUNPV4VG7D7ZEEUI3OPQ,True,13,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R1NL6NRC83D8N1,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Audiophile Perspective,A. Matthewson,4,"I got the MX4's for use when driving and in a noisy office location while doing college work. I also listen to music and audiobooks/podcasts nearly all day, and it is not uncommon for me to have a pair of cans on for 8-12 hours daily. Moving forward, my main comparison is with the Senheiser HD599 ($200) and the HiFiman HE4XX's ($150, plus $200 for a Schitt Modi/Magni DAC and AMP setup, coming to a total of $350 for all three pieces of hardware). My use case is pretty high-volume listening therefore, and my musical tastes go from Jazz, Pop and Trap to Classical, Folk, Acoustic, and Rock. Overall, I would definitely recommend the MX4's IF you are needing the top-end noise cancelation, as the hype surrounding the NC performance is definitely more reality than fiction. It makes my commutes and listening experience in noisy environments, including an interstate, very enjoyable and less fatiguing. I also certainly enjoy the convenience and mobility of these headphones, and the battery life has been excellent thus far. However, if you do not need the absolute best noise cancelling, or maybe don't care so much about mobility, then I would not recommend them due chiefly for the price and audio quality compromise. I shall elaborate, first with what I like:- Comfort (though for bigger ears it may be a little less so).- Build quality is good for a headphone in this price bracket, given the tech.- Noise cancelling is honestly unbelievable, though please note these are my very first pair of NC headphones.- Decent sound for what it is, with good battery life to boot.- Cool intelligent tech, though admittedly I do not use it at all (I keep NC on at all times and do not utilize the speech recognition feature).- Mobility.- Truly some great tech thrown in here, and I can see the R&D going to work, also fairly useful app.Cons:- Price.- Sound quality is lacking when compared to setups at this price point (though I hear it is the best sound quality when comparing to other NC cans), however more on this below.- Ears can become warm after a while.- This may be just me, but I have issues with ear pressure changes throughout the day and can cause a feeling of needing to - and not being able to - ""pop"" my ears, which is annoying and causes long-term comfort to be an issue for long sessions, forcing me to switch back to my faithful 599's.To elaborate, I have HiFiman x Drop HE4XX'S, with a Schitt Modi/Magni stack DAC/AMP. This entire package cost me the same exact price as the MX4's from Sony, and the sound quality is essentially night and day difference. Sound stage, separation, and dynamic sound range is definitely noticeably worse on the MX4's, and there is significant bleed through the bass and mids in some songs. For reference I am listening on Tidal, with Master track quality. Even on my HE4XX's, the bass is tighter and more responsive, and, while not a bass-havy pair of cans, provides a much more accurate and tight listening experience across all ranges. This is partially due to the open back versus closed back design, but again for the price, if you do not care about being so mobile, or perhaps work from home or are a student doing much of your work and homework from a home office or fixed location like myself, I would suggest looking elsewhere. If you travel all the time and absolutely cannot live without maximum portability and noise cancelling, then the MX4's are the way to go. The sound quality is adequate (though I still grit my teeth when considering how much these cost compared to my true audiophile headphone set ups given the sound quality), especially when compared to other closed-back designs, and again the NC is absolutely insane. Another point is that firmware updates will hopefully keep improving on the already impressive and interesting tech inside these cans.All in all, I really do like the MX4's, but due to the price, it makes me hard to recommend to someone who cares chiefly about sound quality first, and the convenience and portability/NC factors second. If this is the case, I'd say go to something with a better sound profile, and you will likely find yourself spending less with a better musical experience, and a recommendation off the top of my head would be the EXCELLENT Senheiser HD599's (around $200 new on Amazon). Personally, if they would have saved on some R&D and kept the voice and calling features to a minimum but dropped the price, this would be a no-brainer for everyone, but I digress. If however, you need the solid NC and are excited about the mobility and convenience and the versatility that these cans can bring, and are okay with the compromise on sound quality as well as the steep asking price, I would say you would be hard-pressed to go anywhere else than the MX4's. I am still debating on keeping these or not, as I have been spoiled with amazing sound experiences for the past 3-5 years now, and I find it hard to take a hit to my pocketbook like this when I could get a truly awe-inspiring pair of audiophile cans to use with my current setup for the same exact price, though the MX4's are good enough to make it a hard decision which is itself a promising sign.Tldr; Should you buy the MX4's? It depends, but I do like them, and you need to just consider your use case when making that decision. This is a lot of money to spend on a pair of headphones, and if sound quality plays a large part in your decision, you have some serious competition to look at. Would I say I recommend the MX4's in general? Yes.","Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2020",AEHBO45A5VT7QL4WOIMAXEQOW26Q,True,21,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
R1Z8K8GMOUV106,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Truly a Worthy Successor to the WH1000xm3!,Bradley,5,"Honestly, there was a part of me that was worried that these headphones would not be the best pair to own after the issues that I experienced with the prior generation of them: the WH1000xm3. The main issue that I had? The build quality: the plastic around the headband snapped due to a flimsy connection, resulting in me having to tape both headbands together so that the headphones don't fall apart on me. I tried several alternate brands to see if they would work, but they never came close to giving me the same level of satisfaction while wearing them as the WH1000xm3 did, even with the taped headband taken into account. So I decided that the best replacement for a Sony headphone was another Sony headphone, and I invested in the M4, which succeeded the M3 last year (as of this writing).My initial thoughts were as follows: the headphones were a definite improvement upon the originals, retaining what I liked most about the original headphones (largely the overall comfort) while also improving the headphones in other small ways (especially in regards to the special features-the M4 are way more feature-packed than the M3 were, incorporating many elements that are being found on most other headphones these days). My favorite thing that was fixed, however, was the sound quality. You see, the original sounded amazing, and honestly sounded better overall than the likes of Bose and Sennheiser, which I have tested as potential replacements for the Sony headphones. And that is despite the fact that the headphones have a relatively small 40mm driver inside, instead of a more traditional 50mm driver. However, the one minor issue I had with the M3 was that the low frequencies were heightened a bit more than I would have liked, making songs sound a bit bass-heavy even when the EQ was turned off (the only way I was able to fix this was by setting the EQ to 'bright', which isn't ideal since the EQ does degrade the battery life). With the M4, Sony improves this by tuning down the low ends, resulting in the headphones having a very flat frequency response, which in turn results in every song having a much wider sound stage than the M3 did (and almost making them sound as good as the various open-back headphones I have tried, including the Sennheiser 650, which is my personal favorite open-back headphone).In terms of the special features, I think they were implemented quite well in these headphones. The noise cancelling is exceptional, much like it was on the M3, and the transparency mode is somehow even better than it was on the prior generation headphone, sounding a lot more natural and less tinny overall. The auto activation of transparency mode during conversations is fantastic, and enables me to talk to people naturally without ever having to remove the headphones from my ear. This also means that I don't have to awkwardly tap my hand on the earcup with the M4, either. The DSEE Extreme audio enhancer really helps to make music sound a lot more full, even when using devices that don't support the LDAC wireless standard. It isn't as good as listening to lossless files wired, mind you, but it is still an amazing feature that helps to take advantage of the flat sound stage and frequency response of the headphone drivers.Now, this isn't to say that these headphones don't have issues, mind you. The auto-pause when removing the headphones from your ears is very much a gimmick, and doesn't always pause the song (and may even resume the music before you have a chance to place the headphones back on your ear). Since the headphones use a light sensor to tell if you are wearing your headphones or not, it means even a simple shadow can cause the headphones to think that they are back on your ears and restart music playback. It is quite obnoxious, and it is best left out. Another, more minor issue is the touch controls. While I personally have no issue with them, I know that there are many people that don't like them whatsoever. So I will just make a note that they are still here, and they work in much the same way as they did on the M3. Finally, I should mention that the flat soundstage, while amazing for my listening experience, may not be for everyone. Bassheads in particular would likely prefer extra pronunciation on the lower ranges. And while they will never be quite as bass-heavy as the Skullcandy or Beats line, the EQ can still bring the bass levels up quite a bit, using a 'clear bass' slider that reminds me of the slider on the Skullcandy Skullcrushers: raising the bass without causing distortion.Overall, the headphones turned out to be quite an exceptional pair, especially when it comes to listening to music during commutes. The great noise cancelling, beautiful audio, and fantastic transparency mode definitely make these headphones a winner in my book. And the app only helps to improve the flexibility of the headphones, allowing for many different features to be unlocked. And while these headphones certainly have some issues (no pair of headphones are perfect, after all), I think the benefits more than outweigh the issues for me, and put these at the top of my list of best closed-back headphones that I have worn. Hopefully Sony will continue to make amazing headphones like these in the ears to come.","Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2021",AFKIZZFUQDOWZ72ZQFX6UJBSPDCQ,True,167,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only
R8H3J5IAMVQYO,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars My review is effectively these should be xm 3.1 not 4 build but good otherwise.,s,5,"about the same as the xm3. the pairing aspect is nice and was my reason to upgrade. I couldn't take all the paring issues anymore, and having more control in my phone to move between all my computers was appreciated.The app does only pair to 2 devices, but it keeps a memory or list of the devices you have paired to (it is not easy to find this information online). I should probably make some youtube video. Having this management aspect makes these so much more usable. They should back-port this to xm3 as well even if only one device at a time software control is so helpful. I''m in software and have to switch computers and phones a lot.Otherwise, i the anc is superior to xm3, mildly so. For me the reason to upgrade is if you want excellent multiparing. Frankly it seems to just work better. Even single paring for me was always dicey on the xm3 there are some devices it just wouldn't pair with. Not the case with these. The sound and anc aren't really reasons to upgrade. they all sound fantastic.The lacking issue is still build quality. they look nice, but the qc 25/35 which i also own use metal in the hinges and i am certain will last longer from a build standpoint. I 've pretty much taken the xm3 apart, they are all plastic, and you better be careful. That said these are so easy to work on. I have opened up my xm3's replaced the battery and pads and they are still going strong at almost 3 years now. I upgraded because i literally use these every day, i actually sleep in them and the multiparing was wearing on me. Given how much they are used it was worth it for me.As long as these sony continue to make great anc headphones, and keep them serviceable i'll continue to go sony. The tipping point is the sound vs bose. Don't get me wrong bose gets a really bad rep in my opinion. They are not bad in any way and still have better build quality and calls. sure they are a bluetooth headphone. I have high end stuff too they don't have that kind of detail. But you know what. These are the headphones i used. I don't especially like being tethered to a computer. Anyway with bose the sound just isn't as fun. For me when you using headpones with small speakers, you to tune warm unlike large receiver speakers. I could even say if your a bit older losing your ability to detect highs maybe then bose makes sense, or your tastes are more for a flat neutral. the sound bose is good. However that's isn't me at all if i want that i'll have a chat with my wife. I don't want boomy but i do want a warm sound that's exciting. these are the best sounding bluetooth headphones with ANC i 've heard and they are plenty good enough for me. I will pretty much continue to live in my xm4 now at my desk and when i am out use my xm3s. By the way i picked these on verizon for some insane deal. They were like 250 already. I'd wait for black friday. i was going to, but then that came up. 350's a lot for this build quality, but if you haven't used these and are on the fence amazon is good because of the return policy if you don't like them. I really do think this is one of those rare great products, and i have had so much use out of my xm3. the pause /turn off when take off is also wonderful. I had that on my plantronics and am glad they added that here. The speak to chat feature is also nice. I like the low sensitivity mode.I have ultimately decided good anc is so worth it. I have way lower stress. Just the other day i was working at home, and there is all this construction going on i didn't even notice it, and i could see how stressed out my wife was. I also have kids and dogs, I put these things on and I am like a bachelor. I use them everywhere card, yard worksconcentration, sleep. It's just fantastic technology. Even if your working out and you are on some loud exercise equipment you can use these and save your ears and hear the tv. They aren't waterproof, but i just put on a fan when i am working out to prevent sweating and that works great. I am also glad they aren't water proof so i can easily replace the battery for 15 dollars. It has a freaking plug and doesn't even need to be soldered. xm4 is the same. Get these. :)","Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2020",AH53ZBSOM7ZRSWR6RACMNAE32SZQ,True,18,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R3D4YJSFPEC0YM,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise cancelling, bluetooth range, sound very good, comfortable, horrible user controls",TechPicky,4,"A disclaimer: I received this product as part of Amazon’s Vine program. While I didn’t pay for the item, the review is totally my personal, unbiased review. Neither Amazon, nor the vendor has influenced this review in any way.ProsExcellent noise cancellingVery good sound quality for all Bluetooth profiles (Listening to music, phone/video calls)Battery lifeExcellent Bluetooth rangeAutomatic voice detection to pause music and enter transparency modeConsTouch controls are simply awful!Dual Bluetooth device supportConstant beeps and noise cancelling turned off especially with “Detection of Actions” enabledVoice detection for stopping music and going into a transparency mode responds to almost any sound you make. A large breath, grunt, anything will trigger this feature.Rubs on the “helix” outer part of the ear on the left earSomewhat complex set up processOverall these are really excellent Bluetooth headphones. The noise cancellation is absolutely excellent. This is probably the best noise-cancelling headphone available. The Bluetooth range is also exceptional. Audio quality for music is also very good, and I expect most people will find them to be excellent. Phone/video call audio is also good receiving, and acceptable for the microphone. They have long battery life and charge quickly. They are relatively comfortable as well. The touch user controls are simply dreadful. There are many other features with a range of benefit.Comfort:They seem comfortable, and the ear pads are soft and plush. However after several hours the outside of my ears start to hurt from rubbing on the insides of the headphones (the area called helix on top of the ear rubs on the inside of the left ear around optical sensor area.) If at sometime we resume taking long international flights this could be an even larger issue.They are still comfortable though when wearing them with glasses. They ear pads are pliant enough to continue to make a good seal without painfully pushing them into your head.Bluetooth, Pairing, Multiple devices:These support 2 Bluetooth devices to be connected simultaneously. The Bose QC35 has had this feature for some time. I initially paired my iPhone X with the headphones. I then added a MacBook Pro from within the Connect app. I was then able to play music from the MacBook. I went back to the iPhone and tried to play something. It didn’t immediately play. In fact, it is rather finicky. Sometimes starting something with audio on the iPhone will cause audio to switch. Mostly it doesn’t if something is playing already on one device. Stopping the audio, waiting, and then starting the audio on the phone is a bit more reliable. Even if the source on one device is paused and not playing it may not switch back.This is a bit problematic though since the iPhone still thinks it is connected to a Bluetooth headphone, so the audio is still routed to the Sony WH-1000MX4, but isn’t played – so it goes no where. This works far more seamlessly on the Bose QC35. I actually found myself disabling this feature half the time.While the WH-1000MX4 does have voice announcements, it doesn’t speak the name of the device. It will say “Bluetooth device 1 connected,” whereas the Bose QC35 will speak “Joe’s iPhone.” Even more confusing is that device 1 and device 2 doesn’t always refer to the same device. Sometimes my iPhone is device 1 and other times it is device 2. The only way to really know is to go into the app where it will identify the device associated with device 1 and device 2.I added a 3rd Bluetooth device, again from the app. This works, but will disconnect one of the 2 already connected devices. It works pretty much like most Bluetooth devices. You disconnect at least one of the currently connected devices and then connect the new device. You can have multiple devices paired, but a maximum of 2 devices currently connected. You can see the list of devices within the Connect app.Bluetooth range is excellent. It would easily stay connected when going from one area of a reasonably large house to another. The range exceeds any other Bluetooth headphones.Sound Quality:Sound quality has to be the most subjective area to evaluate, yet one of the most important. Most people will find these really very good to excellent. For most these may well be the best sounding headphones they have ever had. Those more critical may find a few areas where they lack, but still they are excellent for noise cancelling headphones. Sound quality is probably one of the best aspects of these headphones.The sound quality when listening to high quality content was very enjoyable. Overall they are fairly well balanced, albeit a bit heavy on the low end, but not boomy or with obvious peaks in the response. More so they sound “warm.” The bass is noticeable, and quite deep. You will clearly hear the thump of a drum, but still somewhat tight. The deep bass on some of the Billie Eilish tracks is impressive. The bass is not so excessive though that it drowns out mid or high frequencies. Music sounds good with individual instruments clearly identified. Male and female vocals sound good and natural.The deep warm bass works well for movies and similar entertainment. These will likely work quite well for watching airplane entertainment. High frequencies are clear, and more smooth than harsh. They are balanced overall with a bit more low frequency emphasis that shifts the balance a bit.The iPhone app does have equalization settings, so it is possible to adjust to your personal preferences. I reviewed these set at flat, default setting.If one is going to compare these to audiophile headphones they will clearly notice differences. They will not replace examples of the best open or closed back audiophile headphones. They simply lack the detail, imaging and placement that those headphones present when paired with a quality DAC and headphone amplifier. That really isn’t a fair comparison though as these are noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones and they do a great job at that.I did listen through both Bluetooth with the AAC codec and wired with a quality external DAC while listening to high resolution content streamed from Tidal through a Master Quality Authenticated DAC. They do sound better with the same content played through a wired DAC than Bluetooth. The difference wasn’t as much was expected. Sony did a good job with Bluetooth. I also tried listening to them with the power off, as plain wired headphones. They didn’t sound that different, which is rather a good thing. The same experiment with Bose QC35s will have a totally different sound. Bose relies extensively on equalization to get their otherwise somewhat poor sounding headphones to sound good. Sony starts out with decent sounding drivers.I have not tried using the LDAC hi-resolution Bluetooth codec yet. This isn’t as easy as it would seem to use on either iOS or MacOS. You can’t simply use a high-resolution source to use it. You need to download and install the Sony Music Center app, then load the high-resolution content into that app to play. I’m not sure how to get it to work with a Mac at all. The better codec should sound better. To be fair, at least part of the problem is Apple in this case.I did try the DSEE Extreme feature. This supposedly improves the sound quality of low bit rate compressed content. I listened to some low bit rate MP3 files, and some standard streaming services, such as Amazon Prime music. It sounded different, I’m not sure I would say it sounded better. At least what I noticed was a boost in high frequencies. It made some of the squashed high frequency details more noticeable, but they still sounded highly compressed, and to some extent the compression artifacts became more noticeable. This may well be a personal choice, and likely varies over content, level of compression, and codecs used. The bottom line is that you really need to start with quality content.The 360 Reality Audio was a disappointment. I tried playing a variety of tracks in 360 Reality Audio on Tidal. I did this using the Tidal app on both iPhone and a Mac. I did link the Tidal app with the Sony app as part of the initial setup. I did notice a wider sound stage. It wasn’t like demos in a movie theater for Dolby Atmos or anything that dramatic. There was some front/rear placement depth. It was interesting to play with for a while. What I found though is that it just sounded strange. I played some of the same tracks on Tidal HiFi or MQA and to me they sounded much better, much more musical. Call me a purist, audiophile, or whatever, but I found the highly processed audio more annoying than enjoyable. It doesn’t replace the stereo imaging or placement that superb headphones can present as described above. Honestly overall these sound good enough without these audio tricks. Perhaps if there were some movie encoded with 360 Audio it would be better to enjoy special effects and less about musicality. It seems more of a gimmick than musical. By far the best quality was the same song in Master Quality on Tidal with an external DAC and the 3.5mm wired cable.Phone callsThe audio quality on phone and video calls has been excellent on the receiving side and is about as good as Bluetooth HFP profile gets. it is excellent for conversations. With the excellent noise cancellation these are excellent for long video calls. They will likely continue to be great for those forced to endure a noisy open office environment, or need to make phone calls in a noisy area such as an airport or train station.Phone call microphone:Overall I’ve had only a few complaints from those that I’ve in meetings or on calls with. Most people said I sounded fine. I was on one phone call with my iPhone and the person had difficulty understanding me and could hear me fine when I switched to the iPhone. They said I sounded “far away.” On a video call I had some people refer to the sound as “bubbly.” After switching to AirPod Pros and the sound improved.They seem to isolate ambient noise reasonably well, although I haven’t had extreme cases to try during working from home due to COVID-19. This is one area where Bose QC35 were awful. I don’t know if they match AirPod Pro for microphone beam forming, but so far they seem fine. These work for phone and video calls, but aren’t great.Noise cancellationThese are fantastic at noise cancellation. I haven’t been on an airplane with them, the real test, but these seem significantly better than the already excellent Bose QC35. At least around the house they block out the low frequency sounds that noise-cancelling headphones are best at. Around the house even a Ninja blender was mostly attenuated while I was on a conference call. My neighbor’s air conditioner that still can be heard with the Bose QC35 and AirPod Pros is completely gone with these. I was even using a really loud flooring saw and used these. I did still hear the saw, but not very loud, and I could still enjoy music while sawing flooring! Family talking is mostly gone during conference calls and entirely when playing music. I expect that these would be great in an open office environment or an airplane. Bose QC35 were the best I had used prior to these, and the Bose don’t work nearly as well, especially for voice. They have much better noise cancellation than Apple Air Pod Pro buds too. If your main reason for looking for headphones is noise cancellation, these are what you buy.One annoyance I had with the Bose QC35 headphones is if I wore glasses the sidepieces would create an acoustic leak and let some noise in. They still work, but especially on an airplane you would hear more air noise. I haven’t tried them on an airplane yet due to covid, but so far I don’t notice nearly as much difference as I did with the Bose with glasses.Battery:Sony claims 20 hours of battery life without defining what mode. Other headphones sometimes have decreased battery life with HFP (phone calls). These definitely exceed the rated battery life. With the first charge they lasted almost a week of varied use. I used them for a multi-day virtual conference, and other meetings (combination of HFP and A2DP) for over 14 hours, and they still had 60% charge. Sony doesn’t specify any longer battery life with the wired cable. On the Bose I would plug the cable in when I would go to sleep on international flights, and Bose quoted 40 hours like that, so 20 hours isn’t fantastic. It is more than enough though. It will get you through the longest flight plus some other use. Almost any other use it should be more than enough. I used them over 10 hours straight one day and they were still around 70% charged.Charging:These charge with a USB-C connector. They come with a very short (about 6”) USB-A to C cable but no power supply. They charge relatively quickly (less than an hour from 20%, but I didn’t time it). You will need around a 10W power supply to get the fastest charging. I monitored the charge current from 20% capacity. They started at 0.44A or roughly 2.2W, which seemed reasonable for headphones. Then they jumped to 1.32A or about 6.66W, then to the maximum I saw was 1.8A or about 9 W! It is surprising that Sony pushed that much power into a headphone! The actually battery capacity has to be pretty large, so it apparently does use quite a bit of power. In most cases this is of no issue, they charge up quick. It can be an issue is if you are stuck trying to charge them in an airport or airplane port. They will also suck a lot out of a battery pack.User interface:This is the worst aspect of these headphones. The touch controls are simply dreadful, almost unusable. Simple buttons would have been much better. Even with practice it is almost impossible to master the gestures to go forward, backward, start/stop, and change the volume. Either it doesn’t register the touch, or it does the wrong thing. You try and turn the volume down and track changes. To be fair, they do have a volume control. The Air Pods Pro don’t and that is really annoying. Even with practice controls don’t work right.Some guidance: to change the volume, especially lower it, swipe down on the right ear as if you are petting it. Just swiping as if using a smartphone touch screen won’t work right. Swipe down from above the top just like petting it, and then it might change the volume. Changing tracks is even harder, and only seems to happen when trying to change the volume. Hitting the start stop button doesn’t seem to work, except of course when you try to adjust the headphone on your head and then it stops what you were listening to, and would likely hang up a call – be careful of that. I end up using controls on my phone or computer most times. Simple buttons would have been SO much better.Voice assistant:Setting up Alexa is not all that easy. Assuming the headphones are already set for Alexa, you already have the Alexa app installed and set up, and the headphones are already paired to the phone you still need to add the WH1000MX4 to Alexa. This takes going to the Alexa app, and adding the device. It will then want to pair with Bluetooth. I put the WH1000MX4 into pairing mode by using the almost hidden mode of holding the power button (rather than the app). It then showed it failed to connect, but it actually seemed to pair on the second attempt. If you were successful you will have a second pairing of the device as LE_-WH1000XM4, for a second Bluetooth Low Energy pairing.Then Alexa did work hands free (if enabled in the Alexa app). You could just say Alexa and it worked. You could ask Alexa what ever you normally would. It seemed to actually work better than the Echo Auto that also relies on the app. The response audio always has the first syllable of cut off though. This works fine for querying Alexa, or invoking Alexa content. It does NOT work for controlling other functions on the phone, even changing the volume. Telling Alexa to play won’t resume what was playing on the phone, it will resume what the Alexa app used last it seems. This may be iPhone limitations, but I will likely switch to Siri and see if that works better. It would be great if you could have all of them and just invoke the desired one with the appropriate wake word (Alexa, Hey Siri, OK Google). I haven’t tried other voice assistants with these yet.The automatic speak to chat feature is both great and annoying. At least with the sensitivity set to automatic it will detect voice quite well and stop the content you may be listening to, and allow ambient sound to be heard. This, when desired is far more convenient than Air Pods Pro where you have to hold be button for a few seconds to go into transparency mode. While you still can’t hear what someone says to you, at least when you reply to them, it immediately lets you hear them, and doesn’t take the seconds the Air Pods do. With AirPods you also need 2 actions to stop music and enter transparency mode. This mostly works. In the automatic mode it doesn’t need to actually be voice that triggers it. Anything like a grunt, large breath, anything it seems will trigger it. The slightest grunt or sound and they stopped the music and went into ambient mode. There is a low sensitivity mode that I haven’t tried yet. You will find this feature to be a love/hate relationship after a while. Even with the “Focus on Voice” feature enabled this still seems to be overly sensitive.Another feature is adaptive sound control. This is supposed to optimize the sound based on location, and detection of actions. This is likely useful when changing between an office, train station, etc. I haven’t evaluated that during a pandemic.As for automatic detection of actions, that can be very annoying. It was fine when sitting in one place. Initially I didn’t know why EVERY time I bent down the headphones would beep and go out of noise cancelling mode. Then resume playing normally. This is apparently the notification for detection of actions. This can be disabled in the app. If someone were to use these headphones in a gym or exercising this would be annoying as well. (Note: These are NOT sport headphones!) AppThe app is essential to setting up, using, adjusting, and updating the headphones. Sony even uses the app for pairing with the iPhone, which is unusual. The app allows configuring the many options available, equalization and more. You also use the app to optimize the headphones for the shape of your ears by taking a picture of your head and both ears. I went through the whole process.There are a lot of options in the app, and the layout is OK. It can be a bit confusing.The app does provide a lot of control and information. It shows battery level, and the current codec in use. This last part I really like, Apple typically doesn’t show these details. Many options can beyond simply being enabled or disabled from the app can also be further controlled.Case, accessoriesA nice rigid fabric coated and lined travel case is provided. It is similar in size to the Bose QC35. It appears that it would protect the headphones and hold up well with travel.A 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable is included. This allows using the headphones with a wired source, such as an airplane entertainment system. The cable does not have a microphone or controls and will not control and iPhone, iPad, or Mac or support calling. It is only a 3-conductor plug for stereo listening.While the Bose QC35 headphones come with an equivalent cable, the Bose QC25 cable, or the Amazon Basics alternative cable can be purchased that does allow using the QC35 for phone calls, and wired remote.Also included is a short USB-A to USB-C charge cable, no charger, and the old 2-pin airplane adapter.","Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2020",AE7DZ3XTVG6DTUFU2KBE52MDPL4A,True,582,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R2RUMUO1GMQ7JX,B0863TXGM3,3.0 out of 5 stars Not everything I ever dreamed of...,Andrew Cousineau,3,"I spent more on these headphones than I ever have on a pair of headphones before, so I was hoping that on top of the normal duties of a pair of headphones, that they would also wash my dishes and walk my dog for me ect. To be fair, they are probably the best headphones I've ever owned (which they should be as they're like double the price of the last 'expensive' pair I bought), but they didn't really wow me either.The noise cancelling and sound quality is generally fine. I'm a bassist, so if the bass is emphasized, I'm happy. I don't really notice the bass to be particularly heavy. I can usually distinctly hear bass lines if I make a conscious effot, but they don't tend to overpower (which I prefer, but I know a lot of people don't). I haven't messed around with the equalizer much so I can't speak to that. My issue with the sound quality is in the ambient sound mode. The ambient sound mode makes the ambient sounds sound horrible. This is largely my first experience with noise cancelling, so I don't have anything to compare it to, maybe we just don't have the tech yet to amplify sounds and not make them sound tinney and horrible. But yeah, it legit sounds like I'm listening to the world through a tin can. As a result I rarely use the ambient sound mode (this mode has noise cancelling but allows for some noises to come through) and rather just use the noise cancelling mode when I want to be aware of my surroundings.These headphones have several annoying features that if I knew I'd dislike so much I would've gone for another pair of headphones. First, the touch controls. Apparently there are some people out there who like the touch controls, but are they really necessary when buttons exist? Touch controls only make sense when there is a screen you can look at or at least some sort of tactile cue that reassures you that you're doing the thing you want to be doing. The two most important functions (on/off, and sound cancelling level) are controlled by real buttons, but pause, skip, and volume are all controlled by touch controls on the outside surface of the right headphone. Unless you are sitting perfectly still these are pretty much impossible to use and can result in unwanted pauses and skips. The #1 time I wear these is when I walk/run my dog. I cannot use the touch controls when I'm running and can occasionally use them while I'm walking, but they tend to be very imprecise. So to turn up the volume I have to do the motion like 3 times until I accidentally skip the song instead. This isn't a rare problem where most of the time I can use them fine. This happens the vast majority of times I try to use the touch controls when I'm moving - I'm actually pleasantly surprised if I can do the correct gesture while walking. Some people may argue that I have failed to learn how to use the touch controls (I've had these headphones for 6+ months), but there really shouldn't be a learning curve for being able to pause music - this is a design failure.I also wear these to the gym quite often. The other problem that I have with the touch controls is that I cannot do any sort of exercise with my arms overhead (pull ups, overhead press, ect.) with these on because my shoulder will touch the outside surface and pause or skip. I usually end up taking them off for my set.So, if you're the least bit hesitant about the touch controls, I'd say check out your other options because if I knew they'd be this frustrating I would've bought different headphones.The second overall problem I have with these headphones is how much talking they do. So you'd think, turn them on and play music, right? No, its turn them on, it says ""Power on"". Then it tells you ""Bluetooth connected"" - cool, good to know I can now turn on my music and listen... Unless I have a second device nearby and it says ""Bluetooth second device connected"". Then (because I'm walking my dog away from my second device) it plays a sound to tell me that device has been disconnected. Then I change the noise cancelling level... ""Ambient sound"" which sounds bad so I press the button again... ""Ambient Sound control off"". The robot talks so damn slow, it's literally like a minute of messing around before I can just listen to my music. Y'all really couldn't abbreviate any of this or make it talk faster? And if I want to change the noise cancelling level while listening to music or a podcast I best pause the song otherwise I'll miss half of it listening to the robot tell me what I know I'm doing and can hear the difference between. This is all a bit of an exaggeration, but it's enough to frustrate me. For a $300 pair of headphones I think I have the right to be impatient.Another minor thing that might not actually be the fault of the headphones is they have trouble with certain apps. Sometimes I'll press play on my phone but it won't play through the headphones for like 10 seconds or sometimes more (which is enough time to make me think something is wrong). Again, the headphones could be innocent here - they tend to work fine with the Apple Music app, but not the Apple Podcast app. I'm leaning towards blaming the app.Also the headphones generally comfy to wear. I have a small head, and they can fall off if I'm laying down but its not a huge issue.Overall, these are good headphones, but they have some design choices that make the headphones annoying to use which is frustrating for the price. If these break I won't buy another pair and would likely look for ones that don't have touch control, but I didn't think these issues were enough of a problem to get a refund or anything.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AHVIBRANSX6ITQCAF6SA5XNMQNAA,True,12,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only

Honestly for the price I couldn't recommend a better audio experience. My only complaint is with audio-technica themselves for not manufacturing the smaller parts for replacements. A hinge broke on the right side of mine within a year and half of owning them from being taken off. I contacted Technica and the only replacement part is the headband which is 113.37$. Not considering I'd have to pay another 50 to 80$ to get the work done. They're easily breakable and not easy to work on.

I wanted some headphones that were a little more stylish and high end without sacrificing the sound quality and legit reputation of the M50's. I had read a few reviews complaining about the neutral sound profile of these M70's and I decided to take my chances. I was fully prepared to send these back if I didn't like the sound, but that won't be necessary at all.Right out of the box they look gorgeous in their case. Materials and Industrial Design are absolutely on point. They're not trying too hard (Looking at you Beats) but they certainly stand out over the M50's. The design is simple, pure, and understated. They are much more sleek than the M50's and comfortable as well. The leather on the earpads is nice and soft and the matte finish plastic on the outer earcups is a great touch. Someone went out of their way to create a design that looks great without driving up the price point; which means your money is going where it really matters: Sound quality.I couldn't wait to try these out so the first thing I did was plug them into my iphone 6. The first thing I noticed was the overall clarity and crispness of the sound, and like many of the reviews noted, a rather flat sound profile. It didn't bother me as much as I thought it would, the bass is still there and after trying a few different EQ curves in Spotify I found a good setup. At this point I was very happy with the M70's as an upgrade from my M50's. Next, I plugged them into my desktop computer by way of my Fiio E09K headphone amp. Now we're talking! Its all there. The bass, the mids, the highs. The sound is rich and detailed, a more refined version of my M50's.Overall I'm very happy with these, and it only gets better from here; considering that I've just started listening to them and they haven't burned in yet.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2015",AFLN56XWLCKM4K7ZMP4YZOC2V6IQ,True,7,

I purchased these in the hopes that it would last me for years down the road. This is due in part to the reputability of Audio-Technica. turns out, this ending up being one of the most crucial purchases for my future in music production. When I first tried these on, I thought I fooled myself. I live frugally, so it wasn't an easy choice to drop 200$ on a pair of headphones. It was a great deal though, so I went for it. I could tell that these provide a completely different listening experience compared to commercial listening headphones which I produced with before. Due to these limitations, my mixes were always unprofessional and poor. However, after owning these for a couple of weeks I could tell there was a bit of a learning curve that came with it. Studio headphones operate off of true sound, which can be emulated clear and crisp with these headphones. On songs that were mixed properly, I could easily tell the difference.Build Quality: 9.5/10 - really well done, although the design does look a bit cheap and underwhelming. Smooth matte finishComfort: 8/10 - pretty comfortable over lengthy durations, however, you will need to take them off for a bit after wearing them for a while. Padding is pretty solidSound Quality: 10/10 - Clear mixes with moderate highs and true lows, very accurate soundUnboxing experience: 10/10 - Nice hardcover with a matte finish, comes with a great cable selection.BOTTOM LINE: These are NOT for the everyday headphone listener, you would be much better off purchasing a pair of listening headphones in that case. These headphones are very much meant for mixers and producers looking for a true and clear sound. It will take a bit of adjustment, but it will come eventually. If you are able to create a pretty good sounding mix on these, it will sound phenomenal elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2020",AGCQGOYDQYEPME7IQHBAGTBWYGOQ,True,1,

All of the cables have the one end for locking into headphones so it won't fall off.these have rather narrow soundstage because it forcuses on preciseness; you should look for other pair of headphones (like r70x) if you want a flat tone (neutral) with bigger soundstage.if you really want to, you can also use these outside with 1.2m cable, because it has pretty good noise isolation.again, Don't buy these headphones if you liked the m50x because of the bass. you will dislike it if you like the bass impact on m50x.comfort on these headphones are good enough; if you have a large ear, it might won't fit into ear (my ear perfectly fits into the earcup).","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2015",AE5JDOR3NQMGXGNUXAQLCCIL6XAQ,True,4,

It’s not the file compression, or the equipment, it’s there in the original and it’s way more obvious when the bass isn’t boosted.In general music is pretty muddy for me. I have a slight heating loss. With these headphones I can hear the things I care about, voices, pianos, cellos.I suppose it’s true that you could use an equalizer to more easily make whatever you’re listening to sound just so?I listen a lot to asmr.

The ""Audio-Technica ATH-M70X"" versus the ""Beyerdynamic T1 2nd Gen"".The T1 have a more balanced response and a more distinct low mid-range. The M70X has a brighter upper mid-range and a more muddled lower mid-range. Both did well with bass - I didn't prefer one's response over the other on the music I listened to. Both headphones are comfortable if you are used to fully enclosed headphones. The T1 was more secure and also warmer to wear over time. Neither is heavy (unless you are used to earbuds).One disappointment came with the MX70X wire - it did not include a 1/4 inch stereo plug for use in old audiophile equipment.so I had to come up with an adapter - after going through several I found one that works well within any perceptible noise or a loose connection. The wire is also fairly thin - I would prefer a thicker gauge with a woven sleeve.MX70-X Overall for the price this was a nice find. I will be replacing the wire so some more expense involved.Update: The headphone wire is custom fitted so I can't replace it.

R3CTO8XRCUYQHM,B00SC80YLM,5.0 out of 5 stars Upgraded from M50x to M70x,SuperDad,5,"I previously owned the M50x which I really liked but ended giving them to my nephew as a present since he needed new headphones and I needed an excuse to upgrade to the M70x :-)The two major differences between the M50x and M70x I noticed were:1) Weight: The M70x is noticeably lighter than the M50x which got me worried at first since that usually corresponds to being ""cheaply made""; however, putting them on I noticed that I liked the M70x better on my head and the sound quality was awesome! Sound quality was pretty much the same between the M50x and M70x, the only difference I noticed was at low volume the M70x seemed to isolate me better from outside noise while not pressing so hard on the side of my head which was sometimes an issue with the M50x after extended use.2) Travel case: The M50x came with a small carrying pouch (not a hard case) so you had to be somewhat careful when transporting it around but the M50x was a bit heavier so it seemed like it could take more abuse but I never wanted to test that theory out though. The M70x comes with a hard carrying case which shields it during transportation and is noticeably bigger. Additionally, the M70x does not fold inwardly so the ear cups go inside the headband like the M50x thus making it smaller during storage, instead the M70x ear cups just rotate to lay flat which explains the bigger travel case for the M70x.Conclusion: If you're going to wear headphones all day long or most of the day, I'd recommend spending the extra dollars and investing in the lighter M70x. If you're just going to use the headphones less than a couple of hours a day you'll be fine with the M50x and there's no need to spend the extra money here.","Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2016",AFCPPLHBA7TZC7Y2QYJVQX4WZUUA,True,74,

Ultimately, I came down to these vs the MSR7, also from AT. My use is for general music listening, and I found the others more appealing for that purpose. These have an extremely analytical (for lack of better terms) sound. I read reviews saying that they would be great for making your own mixes, and having played them myself now, I agree with that. You can definitely hear whatever part you want in tremendous detail. The sound staging is good. However, the sum total felt less *musical* than the MSR7 to me. I know that's a vague term, but I hope it makes sense. If I had received these as a gift and didn't have other headphones to compare them with, I would have enjoyed them.

I barely torqued the right earcup in the wrong way and it snapped off entirely. No pin-based failure like before with M50x earcups holding on by the skin of their teeth, (my pair still functions after 4.5 years.) The frame shattered completely at the hinge, with merely the wire connecting the cup to the headphones. Needless to say, I was pissed and glued it back together. Much to my humor, this fix has been much, much more effective than Audio Technica's original plastic at holding these things together, as it's kept strong for a couple months now. (I used some cheap outdoor adhesive, by the way.)

This is my only gripe, though, as these headphones finally stick to what the M in the ATH-M series stands for: studio monitors. Unlike the other M series cans, which have a V shaped sound signature, with detailed bass and highs with a less accentuated mids, the M70x has a flat sound signature. A flat signature produces a neutral sound that is desired when the user is mixing and producing or just into a detailed listening. A flat sound signature isn't as enjoyable to listen to for the average consumer. These headphones therefore sound anemic compared to the others in the M series, but they are one of the best closed back monitors I have used, that flat sound signature is what I wanted when I purchased these and that's what I got.

A bonus is the 3ft straight cable which I use regularly in laptop mode.Note: they don't fold similarly (into a ball) like the m50's or the Sony's so if you are used to that it might be a surprise.

First, I do like audio technica and still think they have the best headphone based on price and sound from anything I have used. So, I am not trying to discredit all the work they put into there products. Sadly though this particular model in my eyes isn't worth the extra money over the M50x's. The material is all plastic and seems that they are actually more fragile than the 50s. The response frequency is flat though which, is why I got them. In other words if you are trying to listen to music in these, DO NOT, it won't sound like your overpowered with low frequencies beats by dre. If you on the other side our into music production it is absolutley amazing. If your project sounds good in these headphones, it will sound good on any speakers out there, I can guarantee that.

Also, the build quality was very disappointing, it is flimsy and made of plastic.

I found it didn't reproduce all the sounds I was looking for in particular pieces of music that I'm very familiar with - different genres (orchestral, hip hop, electro). The voice of the vocalists and/or instruments did not sound like themselves - it did not have that deep richness in the sounds. I guess if you want a flat sounding headphone you got it - no deepness. Though the M70x has superb clarity (not being shrill/muddy in the highs and lows), sad to say my 80 dollar headphones sound marginally better.Soundstage is little.

R1YKS6ECAYKHG2,B00SC80YLM,"5.0 out of 5 stars Very accurate, flat and amazing headphones.",Phil_Pag,5,"When I first got these headphones in, I was a little taken back in a confused way...A little back story; I've been a tracking and live musician for years, but have only recently (1-2 years) gotten into engineering and producing on my own. So I am familiar with accurate (flat) sounding speakers, in-ear monitors, etc.. That being said, I didn't have a ton of experience with studio headphones since I have always used studio monitors 100% of the time, unless I'm actually the one tracking, then I use my in-ears or Ultra-phones for sound isolation.Anyway, I put these on the immediately the day I got them and was almost unsure on how I felt about them. I played every genre of music through them from Miles Davis stuff to Underoath, and everything in between. The thing I immediately noticed about them, however, was how intricate they are. I could truly pick out the finest detail of the music, from very very light snare drum ghost notes on a D'Angelo record to extremely buried guitar or keys parts on an Underoath track. However, I was still thinking that I was missing some low end, and that they were possibly a little to crisp for me. Since these are being used for listening to music 80% of the time, with the occasional accuracy check on mixes, I thought I would want something a little warmer.So after reading and watching a ton of reviews (most I had already read before picking up the M70x) I ordered a pair or M50x's. I will say, first impression, I didn't like them any more or less than the M70x's. I immediately noticed that the M50x's had a SLIGHT boost in the low end, a little boost in the highs, and a little dip in the mids, but overall I didn't think they were EXTREMELY different. After about an hour of listening to the M50x's, I went back to the M70x's for A/B purposes. That's when I immediately realized that (In my opinion) the M70x's are so much more accurate and clear. They aren't bloated in any way and each frequency range from the low low's to the highest of highs (that the human ear can hear that is) are very accurately reproduced. I felt that the M50x's are a little to thin in the mid frequency range, the highs don't seem as clear, and the lows (while more pronounced than the M70x's) where not as clear either. I then started listening to the same tracks back to back on each pair, and realized that the subtle parts I could pick out on the M70x's either weren't as clear, or just plain non-existent. I kept going back and forth between headphones on the same tracks and realized that each track was being represented WAY more accurately on the M70x's.All-in-all, just to be truthful, if I had purchased the M50x's first, I probably wouldn't have the same opinion about them as I do now and the differences are very subtle AT FIRST. And even with all that being said, I still think the M50x's live up to their reputation (for the most part). But these M70x's have opened my ears to so much detail in the music that I have been listening to for quite a while that I just don't think I could go back. It happened so quickly that I returned the M50x's the same day... I'm not a true believer in ""burning in"" headphones, so I hevnt gotten 100+ hours of use out of them. And I will say that It probably took a few days of listening and some comparing for me to notice how much I liked these headphones, but now I absolutely love listening to everything through them. They have really made me realize how bloated the bass is and how much mids are missing from most headphones out there.Oh and the M70x's are super comfortable, where as the M50x's squeeze your head pretty tight and after a while, can actually start to hurt. Design wise, I'd say they're about the same. Both are pretty classy looking with a basic, straight forward studio design.Last thing, I purchased a headphone amp for this and wound up returning it too. Both models really don't need that much power to run the drivers. Even from an iPad or an iPhone. They sounded about the same through the headphone amp as they did directly from whichever source I plugged them into.There may be better or same quality headphones out there for the price. But I am extremely happy with these M70x's.","Reviewed in the United States May 17, 2016",AF7CYPXNNMVJIZ6ZXWIZ3CU5UMXQ,True,28,
RBS4QQ66I5BTT,B00SC80YLM,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic sound and value.,Garland Cary,5,"As noted in my review of the ATH-MSR7, I expect a lot from headphones. As a kid, my family didn't share my affinity for classical music and film scores, so I got used to listening with headphones–first my Dad's Soundesigns, then eventually my own brand new Koss Pro4x. In the 32 years since, headphones have remained my preferred way to listen to music when I'm not socializing. I've simply grown to love the detail and intimacy headphones provide, which I've not experienced with speakers and amps costing tens of thousands of dollars. Since 2009, I've gotten progressively more interested in getting the best possible sound from both my home and portable gear. At home, I listen through the headphone jack of an Onkyo A/V Receiver (can't remember the model, sorry) that plays remarkably well with my favorite open back headphones, the Oppo PM-1, bringing just the right amount of high frequency presence and articulation to otherwise fairly lush cans. I love the sound, and have managed to set the EQ on my Astell & Kern AK100II to yield virtually the same sound, so I can enjoy it on the road, if need be.But it's rare when I take the PM-1 out of the house, despite being easily driven by portable devices–its open-back design simply isn't practical for noisy environments or hushed ones where others might not want to hear my music. So, I've been searching the past two years, fairly intensively, for the right closed back portable headphones. Many have been tried and rejected, more often than not because of poor build quality (creaking and microphonics drive me nuts, especially in expensive cans made with luxury materials, such as the B&W P7!) or unbalanced sound. I'm not a fan of bloated bass or sibilant or artificial-sounding treble. With Momentum (original, 2.0 and Wireless), HP50, M4U1, P7, AH-D600, MDR-1R, SRH1540, Crossfade M100, PM-3 and even Audio-Technica's own MSR7 having failed to strike the right balance, I was prepared to be disappointed by the ATH-M70x.Imagine my surprise, then, to find they are supremely comfortable with creak-free build quality! Period. I can wear them for hours and almost forget they're on my head. Don't get me wrong, they don't LOOK as premium or appear as well-finished as do the MSR7s, but in practice, they are far superior.Okay, so kudos to Audio-Technica on getting the build right! But have they, then, compromised on sound to keep the price down below $300 street? Not at all! Simply put, these are the flattest-sounding headphones I've used since my old Sony MDR-V6–deep, tight bass that's punchy when it's supposed to be, light and nimble when it's supposed to be; energetic mids in perfect balance between the bass and fast, detailed, non-fatiguing treble. Great soundstage, too! Almost as wide and deep as my admittedly not-so-well-imaged-for-open-backs PM-1s. Wow! I love the detailed, balanced sound these deliver. I'm sure I could EQ them to be a bit warmer, to match my PM-1s, but why when that's clearly not their intended purpose. I'll keep my Oppo PM-3 portable planars for when I need/want warmth on the go. But I have a feeling I won't be choosing them over these fantastic M70x very often.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2015",AE5ZHSX52JC3DOZYOPG6GW5IFG6A,True,21,
R13Q5AAUO6YKJD,B00SC80YLM,5.0 out of 5 stars NOT for everyday use like the M50X! These are STUDIO Headphones!,Y. Wang,5,"Let me start off by saying that I am NOT an audiophile. I was trying to find a pair of quality headphones for my wife who is a talented musician. I read numerous headphone reviews and couldn’t understand any of the lingo used like “colorful, v-shaped, flat, rich, neutral,” etc. So for the purposes of this review I will be writing it for other non-audiophiles in plain English words that everyone can understand.First let me give you the conclusions up front:THE GOOD:1. Reasonable price2. Good (not great) construction3. Light weight4. Large earcups5. Good noise isolation6. Very neutral sound (more on this below)THE BAD:1. More plastic than metal2. Boring design3. Don’t fold4. Very neutral sound (read below)5. Low volume (see below)In comparison to the famed M50X, these are the more “premium” headphones. The earcups are larger that fit AROUND your ears for a better seal rather than OVER your ears like the M50x. You’d be forgiven for buying these thinking these are the more expensive and better sounding siblings. Rather, they’re more like cousins. The two are completely different products for completely different needs. You SHOULD NOT UPGRADE from the M50x to the M70x expecting to get better sounding headphones (you will be disappointed), rather you should buy these if you NEED studio headphones. I made the mistake of buying the M50x and then buying the M70x thinking they were better. I did a lot of testing between the two and found the sound they are indeed very different with different characteristics geared to the user with different needs.If you want nice everyday headphones for music listening and enjoyment, DON’T BUY THESE. These are NOT for everyday use at home, in the subway, etc. You would be disappointed with the sound. The M50x is geared for this purpose, it’s tuned with good (but not overbearing) bass, discernible highs and mids for a beautiful listening experience for a number of music types. The M70X is extremely flat and neutral. Other reviews I read state as much also but I didn’t understand what this meant this until I started comparing them. Compared to the M50x, the M70x lack bass, the treble and mids are not as crisp or clear, and the volume of the headphones are extremely low for the same given source volume.While these qualities made them sound like they’re bad headphones for the price, it helps to understand that they were built this way for the discerning professional who makes music. You don’t want extra strong bass hits or shrieking highs when recording or mixing music. Rather you want flat sounds that’s unmodified so you can be closer to the source material. Other consumer headphones like Bose Quietcomfort, Sony MDX, and the M50x are all consumer headphones that have been tuned at the factory to deliver a bassy, punchy, and poppy sound for enjoyment. They may sound better, but it’s not the source material, rather it's a modified and tuned sound.The M70x was designed to be studio headphones, they don’t fold for travel, they’re lighter weight than the M50x for long work sessions, and they’re not designed to be flashy. They’re for the working professional. Even the low sound volume is designed for use with a professional DAC and strong amplifiers so that they blow out the headphones.

Cords and accessories provided are excellent for most consumer products, maybe some professional equipment too. Hardy case that, while not compact, does a good job in protecting the headphones and included accessories.Cons: Its monitoring headphones, so its going to be very flat. Again, bass-heads should steer away from this. Get some Beats or something else if you want more bass. Build quality for a product of this cost tier is extremely poor - some folks had theirs break in 2 months, mine in 4 years after a weak tug by the cord - yes, this is poor handling, but it shows that the m70x uses plastic and not other materials for the joints and swivels.

R2AP817ZT1IYM1,B00SC80YLM,4.0 out of 5 stars Swivel hinge WILL break - design flaw,David,4,"2024 UPDATE : the JB Weld 2 part epoxy has held the broken hinge well for a couple of years, so it's probably stronger now than when new. Combined with the fact I got these at a healthy discount, I will change the rating from 1 to 4 stars. These are definitely more accurate than the Beyer 990s to be fair and headphones with this much 600-3k detail are absolutely essential. These remind me of the AirPods Pro 2g in the mids ... if you turn those almost all the way up. I recommend that you don't pay anything close to the list price. I'd give these five stars if they didn't break and were 75$ cheaper.ORIGINAL REVIEW: When the hinge breaks from simple normal use, these 300$ Headphones will not be useable at all. (I did buy mine renewed though they seemed new). Hypothetically lol, if these did not break so easily, I’d give them 4 stars because they do sound good, but are still overpriced. The plastic seems to last up to just around the time the warranty expires. I’ve read in another review that AT will charge $120 plus shipping to replace/repair. These are my second pair of AT headphones to break on the headband plastic. Though I’ve owned several other brands, only ATH headphones have broken this way.Will attempt to repair with super glue and baking soda, and perhaps some tape as well before sending money to AT.* Update edit: super glue worked to initially hold broken section together just enough to apply gorilla tape and JB Weld epoxy (original formula) the next day. This repair seems durable enough for regular use. I purchased beyer 990s when these broke, which I like better, even though 990s are $100 less.","Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2022",AHFSYJMOVYLRNJFHN5DPHZ5K6HLQ,True,5,
R3K2X5C6B5YXL8,B00SC80YLM,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great, affordable monitoring/mixing headphones (ATH-M70x)",Dan-O,5,"I'm sure other people have noted this in their reviews, but in the hopes of preventing more, ""Beats by Dre are better than these!"" types of reviews/comments, it needs to be made clear that these headphones are not made for casual listening. These are reference headphones, designed to have a flat, accurate sound. Beats by Dre and other consumer-level headphones are good at what they are intended for, but they are not good at what these headphones are intended for.If you are making music and need to mix and master your work, these headphones are great for that. Their dynamic range is ridiculous - you can hear extremely low lows and high highs that you're unlikely to hear on consumer headphones because consumer headphones intentionally flatten the range and boost certain frequencies to make music sound ""better"" to the masses. These and other reference headphones try to capture every nuance and defect so that you can catch them in your mixing and mastering process.All told, I'm very impressed with these headphones. The first time I put them on I almost sighed at how comfortable they are compared to the much cheaper headphones I'd been using. The sound is clear and the range is immediately noticeable once you start listening to kick drums and basslines and hear artifacts that you might not pick up with a narrower dynamic range.For me, these are just what I needed - well-made, comfortable, great sound, reasonable price (I got them on sale for $250).I would recommend these for others like me who are starting to take their music production from casual hobbyist to serious student. For those just starting to write/arrange/produce music, I would recommend focusing your budget on other areas, like a good DAW or some of the better VST synths, or hardware midi controllers, etc. Those types of things will be a much better investment early on and will expand your creative possibilities far more than good headphones will.With that said, if you have the money to burn or have a need for some high-quality, reasonably-priced reference headphones, these are a good place to start.These came with a form-fitted carrying case, a coiled cable, a straight cable, and an adapter for the cords. The cords are detachable and lock into place with a twist.","Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2018",AGX2W4WMOKQCLTP7SN4RB5QZXSLQ,True,50,

Allen,5,"As a professional musician, composer, orchestrator, finding a great pair flat-response headphones have been critically important and quite a journey! Examining and comparing many models and their criteria, of both very expensive models and not-so much, has led me to the Audio-Technica ATH-M70X. Am totally blown away! The very smooth, even response, very low to very high, is simply amazing! Listening to John Williams conducting his sensitive theme from ""Schindler's List,"" and hearing/feeling not only the emotions of violin solo, but the violin bow buzz-on-the-string nuance is rather incredible! As others have stated, these are NOT attenuated to add highs or lows, but a true picture of the uncolored, flat-response, pure sound. These are perfect for audio recording engineers and for mixing a clear unadulterated audio picture. Note: DO NOT expect to compare these to other headphones which are used for average, every day leisurely listening, there are tons of those around. ~~ Next, I just listened to a large symphony orchestra with a large pipe organ, VERY smooth and clear response over the entire frequency range of an astonishing 5 to 40,000 hertz! ~~ To try different musical styles, I tried a bit of LL Cool J - still a clear and an awesome pure sound! ~~ Then, a bit of Jacob Collier - such eclectic and a wide variety of sounds - everything clear and transparent! ~~ Then, some a Cappella vocals with Straight No Chaser - heard intricate nuances never heard before. ~~ Then, pure symphony orchestra of Cody Fry's ""Eleanor Rigby"" - am simply blown away at the transparency! ~~ Then, a bit of jazz with Harry Connick Jr - each and every note of his artistry shines through.

They've handled every music genre I have thrown at them with grace. Like others have said, they are not for bass lovers. That being said though, the bass comes through naturally and it sounds so good.Once they are on, noise isolation is OK. With music off, they are so-so. Funny, I laughed at the other reviewer that said he felt that the noise was amplified with these headphones. But, he's not far off. Not saying they amplify the noise. But the muffled sounds feel more present. To me anyway. And apparently to the other reviewer.I have a big head and I don't feel the clamping pressure others have mentioned.

R34A2GTXOXNYWO,B01AZ01E4A,3.0 out of 5 stars Give a lot of clarity. Not for listeners who favor a warm sound.,Derek Lynch,3,"Notes: Headphone reviews are highly subjective. I greatly favor having a warm sound. CNET's Review is a good place to start for an idea of what these headphones offer.I am fan of many types of music and also a warm sound. I purchased these headphones because I wanted to find a more enveloping and ""high end"" listening experience beyond my Koss Porta Pro headphones (which are a much loved base point for pretty much all of my music listening). Beyond CNET's review of these headphones, I wanted to share my experience from the desire to find a higher end experience.These headphones have tons of clarity. If you are looking to hear detail in your recordings these will give you that. There is so much detail that they will reveal issues in streaming quality and recording flaws. In this regard these meet the expectation of ""high res"" as described. I find this is achieved at the sacrifice of some low end and especially mid range (which is scooped) and overall warmth.Listening to Don't Trust Myself from John Mayer's Continuum album, these headphones seemed to have an relatively even balance with good clarity in the highs along with definition and punch in the bass. With it being such a warm recording I found the previously stated tonal characteristics to not stand out too much. It wasn't until i branched into other music that it became more and more noticeable.Noteworthy examples would be In acoustic guitar recordings (e.g. Don Ross), choral music (e.g. Eric Whitacre) and classical (e.g. Tannhauser: Overature by Wagner). In these I found that they were too bright overall for my taste. Listening to Dirty Loops i found the bass to be clear but the synth, keys and other sounds were shrill to the point of not being able to listen to more than one track.I am returning these to find another option because although they give clarity, are comfortable to wear, look cool and have a nice over the ear experience (decent sound isolation with a breathable design), they are too bright for my listening preferences.If you want clarity and are fine with some brightness, these are for you. If you like warmth or want really strong bass, you would do well to look elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2017",AEYPBJOLLPOTTK663GL66VXSY6MQ,True,21,Style: Gun-Metal Grey

My quest started about 7 yrs ago with a set of Sony V-6's Sony MDRV6 Studio Monitor Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil , crisp and clean sound, but the highs were too harsh to listen to at moderate volume for too long, I gave them to my daughters to use when I bought the Koss Pro DJ 100's. They used the V-6's until the earpads fell apart. They have since moved on to earbuds, oh well.... The DJ100's Koss ProDJ100 Headphones were MUCH better! Warm, clean sound and easily driven, they were my go to headphones for a few years until I recently bought the Koss Pro 4s. The Pro 4s Koss Pro4S Full Size Studio Headphones, Black with Silver Trim were an improvement over the 100's and was very happy with them, but as always I'm looking for better headphones than what I had previously. I had gone about as far as I could with Koss Headphones, the next step up was their ESP ""phones"" Koss ESP-950 Electrostatic Stereophone but at about a grand each and the lack of portability, for those reasons they weren't even a consideration. What can I say about them that hasn't already been said? These are the absolute best headphones I've owned, so far... I bought the Audio-Technica MSR7BK to pair with my new Fiio X3 2nd Gen FiiO X3-II High Resolution Music Player (Newest Model) (Black) . First listen straight out of the box they sounded a little on the bright side, but not harsh. After some time they did seem to settle down (could just be my ears adjusting to them, too. I'm still on the fence about burn-in) and sound just the way I had hoped. Side by side with 4s, they both seem to be just as accurate at reproducing sound, but the Audio-Technica's beat them out in the higher frequency range revealing even MORE detail than was possible with the Koss, amplifier noise that was non existent from my Dell d630 laptop (plays 192/24 FLAC perfectly fine) with the Koss revealed itself with the Audio-Technica's.

I own a pair of Fidelio X2s, but I needed a pair of closed cans to block out fan noise in the dorm.Compared to those X2s, the high end has much more presence. Guitars and synths sound crisp and impactful. These headphones don't have the sub-bass ""slam"" the X2s do, however, and that's something I miss.My only complaints would be the sibilance in the 10kHz region. I've tried to reduce it with a foobar2000 EQ plugin, but I haven't been able to tame it. I ran these out of a Schiit Stack 2 (Modi 2, Magni 2, vanilla non-uber versions), a solid-state setup known for its analytical sound. I believe pairing a bright source with a bright headphone is the problem; the highs sound fantastic, but often harsh. I've heard that these headphones sound great with a good tube amp. Also, I used these headphones in an environment with lots of fan noise in the background, and the fans drowned out most of the MSR7's low end. These aren't meant to be noise-cancelling, but keep this in mind if you're going to be using this in a room with tons of white noise.What ultimately forced me to return these headphones was the discomfort I experienced. I wear glasses with thick rims, and they hurt to wear with these headphones. My ear touched the drivers in the cup too, meaning I had to take the MSR7s off every 20 minutes or so.Overall, I'm glad I bought this pair of headphones. Coming from X2s, I've heard a clarity in the mids/highs that I've never heard before.

Think quality over quantity in this case. Treble and detail in general are spectacular. They are extremely revealing. If a file is of poor quality or recorded in low quality, these headphones will expose them.They are not the best at isolating outside noises. You would have to really pump up the volume to block street noises, for example. Personally, I like that I can hear loud sounds around me. I would not enjoy sounds being completely shut off from me while commuting. In a normal office environment, though, I can barely hear outside sounds.A couple of things prevent this product from being perfect for me. First is the comfort. The earpads are soft, but shallow. Most ears will touch the material covering the drivers. They also fit tightly on one's head. It does not bother me, as I have what is considered to be a small head, but those with larger heads may have to make some effort at stretching the headband to their comfort.The cables included seem to be of poor quality. They are thin, have major wire memory, and very poor strain relief. I've already gone through one of the 3 provided (I bought these in October), due to a short developing when using these headphones with a cellphone in a case. For a portable headphone, a fragile cable is almost unacceptable, in my opinion. Audio Technica, please give us stronger cables!Overall, I believe these headphones are a great value in spite of the few negatives I experienced.

I have tested these along side at about 15 headphones (see below for list) in this price range and these were simply the best by far in terms of sound quality. Period. Not only in total, but also each section (sound stage, bass, treble, mids). It's build quality isn't the best when it comes to its feel but it'll last at least a decade.Long Review:Sound Stage: not a single closed-back headphone even comes close, not even the M70x which is very similar to this headphone.Bass: Not boosted like the headphones designed for the current fad but still some head-shaking action on dubstep or hiphop tracks. I never heard a track with this that I thought the bass was drowning or lackingTreble: Crazy crisp. Although the bass and mids don't even come close to lacking, the treble is where it can't get any better. I've tried a +$2500 (two zeros) open back headphone and amp setup (an HD800 through a DNA Stratus) and the treble on this headphone was the same. Compared to it. Besides that setup, nothing is even comparable to this headphone's treble.Mids: Crazy accurateBuild Quality: Doesn't feel the best but will definitely last at least a decade and a half. It creaks when you stretch it out so doesn't give it the best feel. Also, the cable's connector isn't rubber so I feel like it'll break if it bangs around too much.Cons: The creaking, the hard plastic casing jack, synthetic ear-pads (HM5 ear pads fix the over-heating and size issues its stock earpads have), cable has a lot of memory, no volume control on the cable, my hair sometimes gets pulled, and finally, a bit tight when you rest them around your head.Headphones I tested along side this:Sennheiser Momentum on-earSennheiser Momentum 2 on-earSennheiser Momentum around-earSennheiser Momentum 2 around-earV-MODA Crossfade M-100V-MODA Crossfade M-80Sennheiser HD 380 ProBeats ProBeats Studio (the new one)Beats Studio (the old one)Sony MDR-1aB&W P7B&W P5Parrot ZikBeyerdynamic DT-990BeoPlay H8BeoPlay H6Audio-Technica ATH-M50Audio-Technica ATH-M70x","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2015",AEPXD6Q5BXEU6NBTOHNPENPW5QDQ,True,73,Style: Black

Having said that, though, I do listen to a wide variety of music (electronic, rap, indie, pop, classical, etc.), and I've listened to the music I like enough to know what it 'should' sound like. So take this review for what it's worth given that context.If you're reading this review, you've probably already read the extremely detailed review of the non-NC MSR7's posted by DM. It's worth noting that in their MSR7NC release, Audio-Technica seems to have addressed all of the 'cons' listed in the build/appearance/comfort sections of his/her review of the MSR7's. The NC's are comfortable, non-creaky, and there are no other noticeable issues with the build/cable.I've also seen a lot of reviews cautioning bass-heads away from these headphones. I can hear where those people are coming from -- the MSR7's won't blast bass by default. But they do have a balanced overall frequency response -- the bass level is where it should be. And the quality of the bass is excellent; texture and depth are well preserved. Personally, my conclusion after reading those reviews and listening to these headphones is that people complaining about a lack of bass are used to bass-heavy headphones like Beats. Having said that, if you have access to an equalizer, you can adjust the bass to suit your preferences -- bumping it up a bit won't affect the quality of the bass.Overall, I've found the sound quality across a variety of genres to be excellent. The noise cancellation won't block out absolutely everything, but it also won't affect the sound quality or make your ears feel like they're in a vaccuum chamber. It does enough in the settings I've tested it in to keep distractions from detracting from your experience of the music without totally detaching you from the world around you.","Reviewed in the United States December 14, 2017",AEBV7AZ3B7D7BPMGA2T62TR32APA,True,4,Style: Noise-Cancelling Black

I have been looking for a good solid set of cans with a great sound without breaking the bank. To start with these easily outperformed thier little brother the ATH-M50x which I have enjoyed, and that's why I went up a class with these MSR7BKs. I wasn't sure what to expect and wondered if they were actually worth the price. As soon as I took the packaging out of the Amazon box I could see I might have something here. I carefully worked my way through the quality packing and lifted the last layer of soft material and there nestled in a formed fitted holder was a beautiful set of headphones. Black and chrome with a blue inlay around the cup holders, I could smell the leather of the ear pads. I grabbed my amp/dac, hooked in my iPod and fired her up, as I listened I realized I was grinning at a good clean crisp wide frequency sound. These headphones capture a full range of sound very distinctly, from strong although not overpowering bass to the clear sound of light symbols, in this price range I've never heard a better sound coming from a set of headphones.I put them up against my v-moda crossfades and I only had to swap out the phones once to realize the MSR7 outperformed the v-moda. In my opinion they sound like a hopped up finely tuned set of the M50x on steroids. The ear padding is very comfortable and the tension on the cups is firm yet not too tight, there is a good range of adjustment in the headband and my rather large ears fit inside the ear pads.

I have a pair of M50x's as well as with several other pairs of headphones, but these are by far my favorite set now.I can listen to music for hours without my ears having any discomfort from distorted highs or unbearable lows. I hate when people use the word sound stage, as it is something that can't be measured, though I will say that reproduction of different environments is excellent.Your audio source is going to have the greatest impact on your audio quality. If you're plugging these into a phone or PC, you're probably going to be able to hear all the feedback and distortion that already exists even better.So use a good DAC or other source with decent filters and a lossless (or as lossless as possible) audio source and you will be extremely happy with these headphones.These headphones are better than the M50x's. The clarity IMO is about an entire step above them. You will lose a little bass, but the bass in the M50x's creates annoying distortion for most music. I'm able to drive these headphones at higher volumes without any loss in clarity.I use them with the Mayflower ARC DAC. I can highly recommend it. Though I can also recommend the SMSL SD793-II if you're looking for something less expensive.As with all headphones, you will have to buy them and test them for yourself. Sound pressure level is relative to altitude, your ear canal size, and a number of other factors. We're not all hearing the same thing. Just make sure before you rate these headphones you used a good source, not your phone and not your aux port on your PC.

I also have a pair of V-Moda M100s which I would probably list as the Champion of quality for under $500, that is until I listened on the ATH-MSR7BK.There's a new reigning champion of sound in the sub $500 market and trust me, you don't want to miss these. However, I will say the overall clarity of these are so great that you want to make sure the music you are listening to is pristine and high quality (at least 16 bit) because their accuracy has a way of really making bad recordings sound bad- not the headphone's fault.Comfort is kind of a question mark honestly, but only if you wear them for more than an hour at a time. They aren't too heavy but the fit is tight which is also a good thing because it locks more sound in and it's not escaping. I will never understand people getting a set of headphones a negative review based solely on their comfort. If you want comfort, go buy some plush cotton ear muffs. I bought these for their sound quality not their comfort which honestly isn't even the worst among headphones in this class. Also, give these some time to burn in properly, at first the highs will seem overbearing or the bass will sound more recessed but it all balances out after a good burn in ** for amateurs, this does not mean setting them on fire or sticking them under your hair drier ** Have a great time with these!PS, Lady Gaga sounds amazing on these.

I don't claim to be an audiophile and other reviews have done a good job describing the sound, so I will just say that I really like these headphones. I didn't like the stock cables though, so I bought the red 4 ft. Anker 3.5mm Nylon Braided Auxiliary Audio Cable ( Anker 3.5mm Nylon Braided Auxiliary Audio Cable (4ft / 1.2m) Tangle-Free AUX Cable for Beats Headphones, iPods, iPhones, iPads, Home / Car Stereos and More (Red) ). The red nylon cable covering looks good with the gun metal gray / brown pair i bought, which have red accents on the cups.All the pivot points felt solid out of the box, and initially there was no creaking from plastic rubbing on plastic. However, after about two weeks the pivots loosened up a bit and the headphones made a fairy loud creaking noise if I move my head in certain ways. I did a quick google search and found that this problem exists for a variety of headphone models from different manufacturers (AKG, Audio-Technica, Sennheiser, etc.). Many forum posts suggested adding a small amount of lubricant to the pivots.I put a drop of Finish Line Dry Teflon Bike Lubricant on all the pivots (this stuff comes out of the bottle as a thick liquid and then dries to a waxy consistency, so it won't run or leak). For the ones that connect the cups to the yokes, I put the lubricant inside the inside the cups. This required removing a few screws and pulling the cups apart just enough to expose the pivots. This requires a precision phillips screwdriver but was pretty simple (you can find step-by-step instructions specifically for the MSR7 on headphone forums). Lubrication completely eliminated the creaking noises.","Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2016",AGZKX7SQHGVOZQJKHI4CDEQSIU4A,True,3,Style: Gun-Metal Grey

They look like they're built to last and that was actually my top priority in this purchase. Also this is not a priority at all but I was impressed by the packaging and the extra provided cables.But, after a couple days of light use the faux leather is already peeling and flaking off.I’ll preface the audio quality section by admitting I’m no expert. But I have heard a decent variety of good headphones and good speakers, and do some of my own recording and editing. Also got these yesterday so I haven't had a ton of listening experience with them yet, and that which I have has been all 320 kbps mp3's streamed via Spotify.So I like them, but to be honest I am not blown away. I was using my Klipsch bookshelf speakers as a standard and with those it doesn’t really matter what I listen to, it all sounds good. With these headphones it really depends on what I’m listening to. I’ve found that the dynamics and clarity is very good in the mid range. The highs are good enough. But I also think the mid-bass and below leaves a bit to be desired. It’s not muddy or anything, but so quiet. They are not ""punchy"" like, I dunno, Bose headphones and I don’t want that but I definitely expected the lows to be more pronounced.I’ve seen others say the sound stage is great. I would say it's about average for over ear headphones of this price. Nothing particularly impressive.I can tell right off the bat these headphones will make great monitoring headphones for vocals. Vocals and acoustic music and classical is where they really shine for me.

When I got these I didn't push in the jack hard enough to get it to snap in, and as a result it felt like a loose connection and the audio was spotty. I returned these and bought another pair, same thing. I realized it was unlikely for two to come broken with such good reviews, pressed a little harder and the very firm connection snapped into place.As for build quality, these are excellent!

R2W9KAAABD6CZC,B01AZ01E4A,5.0 out of 5 stars Don't compare these to the ATH 50xs,Amazon Customer,5,"When I first got these I immediately tried them out on my Lg v20 and I was initially overwhelmed by the sound. It felt like I was being bombarded with forward and hard sounding details. As someone who came from much warmer and V-sounding headphones it was extremely unpleasing to my ears and not musical whatsoever. Then, I realized that these headphones have extremely sensitive pairing to its source. My v20's DAC made the headphones harsh and coldly detailed. However, paired with an external DAP and my laptop tweaked by B&O (known for warmer+smoother sound), the sound came out finely detailed and smooth. I highly recommend finding a warmer source if you find these to be boring and overly analytical sounding. The MSR7s are said to be near reference quality leaning on bright, and I can confirm this. If you are a basshead, look elsewhere. It's not that the bass is nonexistent on these headphones but it is so clean and appropriate that you might feel like something is lacking. I mostly listen to a lot of EDM and pop music and although they sound perfectly fine, I wouldn't necessarily recommend these pair of headphones for those genres. The MSR7s are mostly a flat sound so they generally sound great with all kinds of genres but maybe Metal and Rock in particular? Anyhow, these headphones are a great deal for this price overall and a joy to listen to in the right setting. The clarity is amazing and due to their accuracy these sound like a mature pair of headphones at this low price.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2017",AGUCD7JJZFJ5LTASFOV2AH6IT4IA,True,4,Style: Black

Right now, it just feels like it squeezes my head too much.That being said, they are still comfortable enough to wear for extended periods of time. It's really an odd thing. The pads are nice, even if it's a bit light in the headband. The high tensile strength is really the only comfort detractor.The Sound is fantastic. The bass is present, and is neither boomy or too light. You could increase the bass presence with the EQ, if you so desire, but it's not necessary for me.So yes. Buy these if you either like high tensile strength headphones, or if you can see yourself getting used to it/loosening them up.***UPDATE***I have now had these headphones for a few months, and I can happily say that they have loosened up significantly. These have morphed from headphones that were uncomfortable to wear for any substantial length of time, to headphones that are extremely comfortable. I can and have worn these for nearly 8 hours straight. If you're intentional about stretching these out, I'd say you can break them in after a couple of weeks.

The cables easily can conform to a shape after being put through stress after a while.

RFPU014R3IFXW,B01AZ01E4A,3.0 out of 5 stars Bass roll-off is an issue,John T,3,"This is really the only headphone purchase I regret. While the detail and soundstage are decent, the bass rolls off way to early. There is virtually no bass. I am not a bass-head (and no, I would never purchase Beats headphones), but I do like to hear some bass without straining to hear it. While the frequency response numbers indicate there is a good range of bass and sub-bass, it is at such a low decibel level, it makes this a mid-range to high frequency headphone. My ATH-M40x headphones, although not as detailed, are more pleasurable to listen to. I don't have any other closed-back headphones to compare these to, but I've got to think there are others in this price range that have a better frequency response. It would be helpful if Amazon would publish response curves like Massdrop does for many of their headphones. Unfortunately, it does not look like Audio Technica wants their sellers to reveal that information. Instead, they only publish that the response is 5-40,000 hz, which looks good until you listen to them and realize you need to EQ them to hear any bass. I am sure there are some people who love these due to the detail in the mids, but any music with bass is muted in the low end.","Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2019",AGMMBEUJ7O3DZJZQY3ADCHGEAN6Q,True,1,Style: Black

I researched this quite a bit before purchasing, and found that I didn't care at ALL about wireless capability. These are wired headphones, and they sound great and are very well made. Great materials. If not a bit bulky, but that is to be expected with over-ear style headphones. I can overlook the lack of foldability, (they do fold, but not in ways that make them more portable). And I can certainly overlook the overall bigness of them because they are lightweight and comfortable. I was on the fence about active sound isolating models and just well built passive sound isolation. These are not active noise killers, but they do a good job of reducing unwanted, ambient noise. I have tested this in my car. Playing music at lowish volume, these headphones block out most high frequency noise (such as slushy noise from tires on half melted snow on pavement). I was also concerned about sound leakage, and because of the solid fit, these don't seem to leak much sound. Headphones are GoOD - I tell ya, güey.

A really nice, well balanced and a natural sound performance. Just enough of bass, high frequencies are in check, crystal clear, natural and very authentic, rich sound. Dance, piano, violin, guitar, vocals-this headphones handle it all. The construction is very solid with high quality materials, and it feels like a very professional product. Its very steady and sits very comfortably and secure on your head without causing any discomfort even with a very prolonged listening.I am highly satisfied with the headphones which i ended up buying on Amazon since it was cheaper.

I have a pair of 558s that I like but don't love and need something that is closed for use at the office. I was hoping these would be it. Sadly, they are not. Having tried the pro700mk2s and liking them, but returned them due to painful clamping I decided to give these a try on sale for 180. At 100 dollars more than my 558s I wasn't too impressed by the sound quality but I was mainly more disappointed that the cups aren't big enough to be comfortable for long periods (my 558s are way larger and more comfortable). My ears rub against the plastic on the inside and since there's not much room things get warm quickly. Also these leak quite a bit of noise, so if your co-workers are close by, I'd say these are a no go. The build quality did seem to be great though and you get a nice selection of cables. If you have smaller ears and like the Audio Technica sound these will probably work quite well for you.

Mids are the focus, sometimes are colored to the point you notice it. The bass is slighly more pronounced than the M70x, however it shows up more at higher volumes. Overall very good sounding headphones, particularly if you like acoustic instruments and vocals. If looking between the M70 and this, it's a toss up. These have slightly more bass (which to me is still slightly less present than for my taste, but you will deal with the colored voicing.

I'm a classical musician and I wanted a pair of cans that reproduce music the way it was assembled in the studio. This means an even distribution of tone from bass to high, with good representation in the mid range. I want to be able to isolate each instrument and these definitely fill the bill. Other reviews have complained about soft bass, and perhaps if your genre is hip-hop, heavy metal, or other bass heavy music, then these are probably not for you. However, I find these to be pretty even across the spectrum. S's are more slightly more evident in rock music, but I can make out each instrument, which is what I wanted. Where these really shine is in the classical genre. Put on Barber's Adagio for Strings, wait for the fermata, and you will not be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2017",AGYJHYD2WXYNNBINWNUUGFB65QGA,True,9,Style: Gun-Metal Grey

I use them daily, and they sound awesome with the kind of music I listen to (Rock, folk, jazz). Fairly comfortable right off the bat, but I got a headband cushion due to the fact that the headband is a bit wide so the point of contact is small and can get sore after long periods of use. The pads are nice but I would recommend larger ones if you plan on using them for hours on end or have large ears. Highs are fantastic, and genres that are mid and high heavy are amazing in these. Mids are also great, although not as good as the highs due to the slight V shaped sound. Low end is very very clean and modest, so most bassy songs will sound great on these, although if you're a fan of the Beats sound or are a bass head, I wouldn't recommend these without some sort of bass boost.

I listen to music fairly loud around 5 hours out of a typical work day, and I could only do maybe an hour straight of listening before feeling the need to give my ears a break.All in all, I LOVE the look and feel of these and wish they would have worked, but guess I have learned I need a bit warmer tone.

The ATH-MSR7BK SonicPro headphones outperform all of these by a noticeable margin. Listening to music with them is truly an amazing experience. I hear things that I hadn't noticed before in music that I am quite familiar with. Across the spectrum, from bass to high treble, the balance is incredible.

I liked the punchy bass from time to time, but found them sloppy and unpredictable - sometimes all I ever heard was mushy bass barfing all over the mix. Maybe this makes a headphone “exciting” but I just got anxious.So after seeing some good reviews on this set, I went with an Amazon Open Box discount. The dive back into ATH world has been successful.I would like to point out that I am middle aged. My hearing isn’t as good as many of you, and while I am certainly not deaf, I find that I have gotten close to my limits with aural resolution. I had a fairly nice setup up with much more expensive headphones, DAC/Amp and so on, but it occurred to me that I couldn’t tell much difference from midpriced phones. I sold the expensive ones and am mucking around here, in the 150-200 range. It seems a sweet spot for my level of hearing ability and investment. Many headphones at this price point are easy to drive and don’t require super fancy DAC/amps to “make them shine.” I really think that phrase is overused at HeadFi.When bothering to compare, my references are the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro (80 Hz) and Senn 598. Honestly, I don’t hear a huge difference between the Beyers and the ATH. There is is definitely a brighter sound in the mids of the ATH, and they don’t feel as forward as the Beyers to me. These are mostly less warm than the Senns, so there are times when classical music on the MSR7 sounds a little harsh to me, though it really depends...The fun surprise to me is that old music sounds new - I think in stuff that was mastered to CD 20 years ago, bass was done with a lighter touch, and maybe some mixes were a little muddier than we find today. With a little brighter sound and deeper bass, the ATH really punches up older tunes: Doobie Brothers sound fantastic, Chicago’s Mongonucleosis rocks again. The bass is WAY better controlled on the MSR7s than the M50. The ginormous surprise here was Michael Jackson’s “Black or White,” which never crossed over to gushy bass lines or brittle guitar. The gorgeously mixed ""Love"" from the Beatles Cirque album sounds splendid. But then it does on almost anything.Once in a great while bass still penetrates a little too deep for me, seemingly with jazz. “Caravan” from Whiplash sounded unnatural, and Maynard Ferguson's fusion didn’t benefit. Quartet level jazz did though. Zoot Sims sounded pretty tight. With a not great Don Byas recording, I felt like I was able to penetrate into a very old mix.With soundtracks like the title track for Finding Nemo, full of little ambient sounds, I could’t ask for more. Vocal soundtracks were hit and miss. Some tenor voices (Les Miz) bordered on harsh.Classical still sounds better to me with an open headphone like the 598. If there is lots of little detail and some intimacy (The Turkish March in Beethoven’s 9th) these can’t be beat. The discriminatory ability of these headphones reveals little gems so often that you have to smile.Overall, I think these are wonderful mid priced headphones that finally make the ATH signature satisfying rather than frustrating. They are fun sounding without being sloppy, particularly for music with a lot of movement or detail going on as they allow the music to sort out rather than mash together. For older music, they freshen the mix, so for us older guys, they are a great choice. I think as an overall go-to headphone, they are an excellent choice, easily driven by a portable device.It comes with a selection of cords. I didn’t use the inline mic. The desktop cord is thin and cheap feeling. It also didn’t come with a 1/4 inch adapter. Oh well.It seems well made and sturdy enough, but I use it for desktop purposes only. Clamping force is a little strong, and my head isn't large. But the ear cushions make up for this, and I haven't had any real trouble with extended listening.The open box item was in excellent condition. The only thing that looked out of place at all was the cord which kinda looked like a kid re-rolled it. Beyond that, no blemishes, etc. Well worth a price 80 bucks off the list.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2015",AH2NRQKZQYGKAKHRSP5YM2E7Y6EQ,True,28,Style: Black
R3G85Z0ITKTBDO,B01AZ01E4A,4.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones!,Steven Mooney,4,"I've been looking at these for a long time and finally decided to grab them while they were on a good sale. The have mostly lived up to my expectations. The sound quality is amazing. They're extremely detailed and much closer to neutral than my m50x. It reaches both higher and lower than those, but prefers quality over quantity in the bass. I prefer my headphones to be on the brighter side, so it's perfect for me. But if you're a basshead, there are plenty of terrible alternatives that I'm sure you'd like more. Imaging is excellent and, as a result, they've been my first choice for gaming lately. Soundstage is fine. Bigger than the m50x, but nothing special. They can be a little too good, if you have a low quality file or maybe a questionable source. You're going to hear all the amazing detail in the music, but also literally every flaw.Comfort is almost perfect. The pads are shallow, but very soft and comfortable. Weight is negligible. And there were no spots on them that were even remotely uncomfortable in any way. I can wear them for 4+ hours and not notice. Most comfortable headphones I've ever worn, by far. The only thing that detracts from it is the rubbery cable. It looks great, since it matches the color of the headphones and has nice sturdy plugs, but it's always in the way and constantly in danger of tangling.The only thing I didn't love about the headphones themselves (and the reason that I ultimately returned them) is the insane creaking that they developed after the first couple hours of use. I'd be immersed in an album or game and everything is perfect. Then, I move my head a fraction of an inch and a ""CREEEEAAAAKKK"" like the door of a haunted house. As long as I sit still, all is right with the world. But that plastic creaking just reverberated inside the headphones like you couldn't imagine. I'd read reviews that mentioned it, but I must have gotten a much worse pair than any of those reviewers.Anyway, they're great (almost perfect, even) headphones. Just hope you get a pair that doesn't make it's own ""music.""","Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2018",AHIRJ4LD7FETGKT6RNWI5H6DTBFQ,True,1,Style: Gun-Metal Grey
R22GLHY5GPFGIM,B01AZ01E4A,5.0 out of 5 stars Great pair of headphones thay took some getting used to,Real Diels,5,"Before I bought these MSR7's, I had a pair of PSB M4U2's. I loved those PSB's, but they broke, and I needed a replacement. After a lot of research, I landed on these Audio Technicas.First of all, they look fantastic. Some of the best looking cans I have ever seen. I love showing these off in public. The overall build quality is very nice; the plastic hinges squeak a little bit too much for my taste, but I've had them for a few months now and everything seems to be holding up well. The included headphone cords are a nice quality cable, not something I would look to replace.Comfort. This was one of the things I needed to get used to. When I first wore the MSR7's, the headband dug into my head and gave me a headache after about and hour. Now, I can listen for a few hours no problem, so it doesn't bother me anymore. The earpads are nice and plush as they should be, plenty big for my ears, but aren't huge or overly soft. If you're going to be listening in public, these are closed back headphones and have relatively low leakage. I don't feel I am bothering anyone on the bus when I listen at a reasonable volume.Now for sound. Lots of people say that the MSR7's have a harsh treble to them. It's true that the highs are very prominent, and when first listening to them, I was a little put back by the ""emphasis"" I heard. I don't consider myself a basshead, but I probably prefer a warmer sound. The MSR7's do not have a warm sound, that's for sure. However, in time I have grown to love the intensely accurate highs, and I use these headphones everyday. Every now and then I wish I could warm up the sound a little and ""relax"" to my music in stead of ""analyzing"" my music, but I am happy with my headphones... for now.For reference, I use an iPod Classic 160GB with Rockbox and 320kbps MP3s or Flac files as my source.","Reviewed in the United States May 21, 2016",AGICFG7Z4BW2NEA7F3CWCHYLFUJQ,True,3,Style: Gun-Metal Grey
R14EEPWBL132IZ,B01AZ01E4A,"5.0 out of 5 stars Semi-flat audio, perfect bass, & a good quality build",Amazonian2005,5,"PROS: The main feature of the headphones, the audio, is exceptional quality, IMO. I primarily bought these for work but found myself using them to monitor some of my mixes in the studio. I do notice some slight bias in the EQ of the output audio while comparing/monitoring samples, 3rd party masters, and personal mixes. As far as bass, it's not too much and not overdone like their cousin, the ATH-M50x. The bass seems accurate enough and smooth. The mids seem to be dropped about 1db and the highs seem spot-on. Maybe the highs are just a tad much higher than what I'd like.Honestly, I feel these are better monitors than the ATH-M50x's--Ironically, they're not marketing the term ""monitoring"" in this model. I suppose they're not made specifically for reference quality or monitoring, but it's good to know that I can use them to prevent background noises with ANC anywhere I use them. Would I suggest these as a studio headphone? It depends--If you're trying to use it solely for mixing/mastering reference audio, it's not made for that IMO. The bias on the audio is slightly there. However, you can use it to hear unwanted clutter in your mix like any good monitoring phones. If you're really skilled, you can still use these for more than minor monitoring in the studio, but you better use your loudspeaker monitors 80% of the time to maintain an accurate frequency (EQ) in your songs. It's great for hi-res sound for regular listening to final/mastered tracks. It's great for noisy environments while trying to listen to music or just reduce noise.COMFORT: The comfort is there and the quality. The pads are soft and seem to be expanding back in their original place after use. I became an Audio-Technica fan after my first pair of ATH-M50x's. Whether these are a bit audio biased or not, Audio-Technica has always had the best sounding cans IMO.CONS: The cable for non-phone use is too short. My M50x's have plenty of cable length and so should these. In the photo, I'm hardly able to route the cord away from my keyboard without it getting in the way. With my 50x's I can move it under and further away making it less annoying.","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2018",AF5NNRA7EWXUTMMFNAZEGBOQYGCA,True,3,Style: Noise-Cancelling Black
R1MC7OUB162CPK,B01AZ01E4A,3.0 out of 5 stars Sounds nice! Too bad about the compromises elsewhere.,Garland Cary,3,"Full disclosure: I expect a lot from headphones. As a kid, my family didn't share my affinity for classical music and film scores, so I got used to listening with headphones–first my Dad's Soundesigns, then eventually my own brand new Koss Pro4x. In the 32 years since, headphones have remained my preferred way to listen to music when I'm not socializing. I've simply grown to love the detail and intimacy headphones provide, which I've not experienced with speakers and amps costing tens of thousands of dollars. Since 2009, I've gotten progressively more interested in getting the best possible sound from both my home and portable gear. At home, I listen through the headphone jack of an Onkyo A/V Receiver (can't remember the model, sorry) that plays remarkably well with my favorite open back headphones, the Oppo PM-1, bringing just the right amount of high frequency presence and articulation to otherwise fairly lush cans. I love the sound, and have managed to set the EQ on my Astell & Kern AK100II to yield virtually the same sound, so I can enjoy it on the road, if need be.But it's rare when I take the PM-1 out of the house, despite being easily driven by portable devices–its open-back design simply isn't practical for noisy environments or hushed ones where others might not want to hear my music. So, I've been searching the past two years, fairly intensively, for the right closed back portable headphones. Many have been tried and rejected, more often than not because of poor build quality (creaking and microphonics drive me nuts, especially in expensive cans made with luxury materials, such as the B&W P7!) or unbalanced sound. I'm not a fan of bloated bass or sibilant or artificial-sounding treble. Momentum (original, 2.0 and Wireless), HP50, M4U1, P7, AH-D600, MDR-1R, SRH1540, Crossfade M100, PM-3 and now the MSR7 have failed to strike the right balance.For me, the Audio-Technica had two terminal flaws:1) Discomfort. The headband exerts an excess of pressure at a single point on the top of my head and, no matter how I position them, the results is soreness! The ear cups also are fairly shallow and my ears get sore (and hot, thanks to the all-synthetic pads) after about 30 minutes of use.2) Build quality. The aluminum adjustment arms of the headband move around to an alarming degree inside the receivers inside the pleather padding of the headband–poor design/engineering that makes them feel cheap. That and the plastic-on-plastic creaking of the yokes and other plastic bits as you strain against the copious caliper pressure to get the headphones deployed on your head. I'd easily have paid another $50-$100 to have this sound from a headphone engineered and built to a higher standard.On the other hand, if you find them comfy and are not bothered by the build quality, there are no better headphones I've tried for an exciting (read, ""V"" shaped) listen with more treble energy than bass emphasis (although the bass level is definitely greater than neutral) but virtually devoid of sibilance. The Marshall Monitors and Denon AH-D600 have similar sound signatures, but with its filter in place, the Marshall headphones lack shimmer and with the filter out, it's sibilance run amok with all but the dullest recordings. Meanwhile, the Denons have a bit stronger (but less defined) bass and oddly synthetic-sounding treble. I only mention them as possible references. I don't recommend either over the MSR7 which, even with its shortcomings, is both sonically superior and a better value.Compared with a warmish source, like my AK100II, the MSR7s sounded lovely, almost a match for the sound of my PM-1 on the Onkyo receiver. Too bad about the poor fit and compromised build quality.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2015",AE5ZHSX52JC3DOZYOPG6GW5IFG6A,True,35,Style: Black
RT1RKPF0O4KZ1,B01AZ01E4A,"5.0 out of 5 stars A spectacular, neutral pair of headphones.",Amanda Bowden,5,"The MSR7 has crisp highs, tight lows, and has an overall neutral sound signature. I've owned these headphones for over a year, have used them for both casual listening and mixing live productions, and they've been excellent.Construction-wise, the earcups are a sturdy aluminum that I'd worry about scuffing before I'd ever consider breaking. The hinges are plastic, but seem to be sturdy. They do make a quiet creaky sound when pulling apart the earcups, but no worse than the M50x's. I carry these in a hard case, and don't worry about them in there, but I would be concerned if someone stepped on these; they aren't as durable-feeling as the M50x's. I got the brown and red pair (solely because they were cheaper), and they're a beautiful pair of headphones. They aren't too flashy without being dull, and look fairly professional. The headband was a little uncomfortable at first, but a little bending and shaping straightened (unstraightened?) that out.Sound-wise, they're excellent. I don't drive these with any DAC or amp, just straight from phone, computer, soundboard, or what-have-you. I owned the M40x's before this and loved them, and while the M40x is already known for being the flatter M50x, the MSR7 sounds flatter and more detailed to my ears than the M40x. Interestingly, comparing a frequency response curve for these to an equal loudness curve, they are quite similar and perhaps supports these as a very neutral headphone. I'd say the only downside to the sound of these is that they can be fatiguing when used for extended periods of time due to their more critical sound signature. That said, I don't think it's anything a little eq'ing couldn't take care of for the few times something more relaxed is needed.In the end, I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again given the opportunity. They're my go-to's for everything.","Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2018",AGFZHSOYRXH4HU3T4WYXPR6YEESQ,True,2,Style: Gun-Metal Grey
R24Y77S7ZX35CW,B01AZ01E4A,2.0 out of 5 stars Ear Pads and head band deteriorating!!!,Traveler,2,I have had these headphones now for over a year. They sound fine. The significant problem that will probably eventually affect all buyers is the SIGNIFICANT deterioration of the head band and ear pads. These earphones have been well cared for and are kept in a drawer to protect them. They are used a couple of times per week and are never abused. At this point both the seat you are seated at as well as clothing and hair are covered with material that crumbles from the softer material. My wife would prefer me to purchase another brand as opposed to cleaning up after use. Looks terrible. I tried several time to upload a photo. The site did not accept the picture.

R2A0T5VSGDAVX2,B01AZ01E4A,"4.0 out of 5 stars Bright, clean (not heavy) bass, and squeaky frame. Still the best at this price.",FLY1NGSQU1RR3L,4,"There are some pretty stellar reviews in here that are accurate and were the basis for my purchase. If you want highly technical reviews about how bright these are and how accurate, but not overpowering the bass is, keep looking. This is a laymen’s review.I am very happy with the MSR7. I do wish there was a headphone this clear and detailed that had a button to turn bass on and off, but I can never go back to a headphone without this detail.My preference is open back planar magnetic so I’m already used to losing a little bass, but I really wanted a nice sound stage. These delivered. For this pair, I needed a closed back solution for work and these are impressing some of my colleagues (which include audio engineers in our game studio). However, instead of leaving these on my desk I find I am wearing them everywhere. I have listened to more music in the past few days than I have since the beginning of the year. I keep feeding these headphones new and old tracks to hear how they sound. What is weird is I’m hearing clarity on individual instruments I could never hear before, in tracks I know from heart. Even if other headphones make a warmer sound, “warm” might be another way of describing when sounds blend together, with less separation.About the bass: I like clean sub bass and listen to a fair amount of EDM music. These are better for my ears than Beats. I don’t feel like these are doing as much damage even though the bass feels missing at times. For an example you can try at home, the Deadpool 2 title song from Celine Dion has this low frequency sound that is super satisfying on my Dolby Atmos system. These headphones reproduce that more cleanly than others and i scour the music catalogs looking for other tracks that use that well. I can listen for longer and have been without fatigue and that earned it five stars...especially for my audio books and movie watching on my commute.About the squeaking: yeah these squeak when you have them around your neck and when taking on and off. Haven’t figured out if the hinges need oil or if a plastic part is rubbing. Not a huge annoyance, but I docked them a star for it. Everything else in this build is great.The main solution I have is to buy a pair of Monoprice M560s to use open back at home so I can have both experiences, because I saved so much money getting these vs the M1060Cs which were my first choice for closed back, but at twice the price that I couldn’t justify in a planar magnetic I couldn’t convert to open when needed and still trust to keep sound in at my desk.Love these headphones, but everything you read about them being bright/cooler is correct. The best thing is that you may find out, thats exactly what you always wanted and didn’t know it.","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2019",AFFFCFFTQBJELHIZMGFTYXBBJKUA,True,7,Style: Gun-Metal Grey
R3SXQUE6DISDX4,B01AZ01E4A,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent headphones with a couple of practical quirks,jimmy,4,"From a purely audio perspective, the SonicPro is the second-best headphones I've owned (the best were a pair of Stax electrostatics made many years ago). The clarity and nuance of sound are superb.Nevertheless, I have two nits to pick. I think they're worth mentioning because it seems to me they shouldn't be present in otherwise high-quality headphones.Nit number 1. Out of the box, one of the earpiece pivots creaked loudly whenever it moved. A noise like this will bother different people to different degrees. As I see it, an audio device that's supposed to generate good sound has no business generating bad sounds of its own. I placed about 1/4 drop of Dupont Teflon Silicone lubricant between the creaking surfaces. The pivot now turns very smoothly--and quietly.Nit number 2. The cables that come with the SonicPro are thinner and more apt to tangle than are the cables of, say, the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. This creates unnecessary hassle. Maybe they'll get better over time, as the cables relax from the tight coils they were packaged in? Meanwhile, I substituted a heavier and more manageable cable from Kabel-Direkt. Please note that the SonicPro headphones do not have the cable locking feature of the ATH-M50x. The SonicPro has an ordinary jack, making cable replacement simple.These ""quirks"" have not caused me to seriously regret this purchase.Follow-up, three months later. The original creak is back. Worse, there are now additional creaks coming from pivots on both sides. How much lube can I apply to these phones without causing some kind of harm? I find this annoyance downgrades the product. Given a second chance, I likely would not buy them again, even though the headphones still sound great when they aren't creaking.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2017",AGWFRYI6T7AHCSDJ3ZXQZOTC4HLQ,True,4,Style: Gun-Metal Grey
